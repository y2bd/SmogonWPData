Chansey and Blissey are especially good partners as they appreciate Wobbuffet's ability to eliminate the Fighting-types that trouble them. Wobbuffet's Encore can really benefit setup sweepers, so Mega Charizard X, Gyarados, Breloom, and Lucario all make good partners.

Thunder provides valuable coverage against Xatu, Starmie, Tentacruel, and Mega Blastoise, which might try to reflect or remove Sticky Web.

Hidden Power Fire is also an option in the final slot to 2HKO Excadrill, Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Forretress, and to OHKO Genesect.

Focus Sash is generally the best item choice as it nearly guarantees that Galvantula will be able to set up Sticky Web in the lead position. However, Life Orb is an option to give Galvantula a secondary role as a speedy, decently powerful attacker and to secure the KOs mentioned earlier."}, {"Content": "Sticky Web should be set up as early as possible. As Galvantula has little defensive synergy and very few switch-in opportunities, it should usually lead or be brought in early-game with U-turn or Volt Switch. Galvantula doesn't require much in the way of complex strategy: set up Sticky Web and then do a little bit of damage or Volt Switch away, depending on the match-up. If the opposing team has an obvious Defog user, it's best to not sacrifice Galvantula right away, as its high Speed might give it the opportunity to set up Sticky Web again. It's also best not to immediately set Sticky Web against teams that carry Bisharp, as the Speed drop will double Bisharp's attack every time it switches in."}, {"Content": "Powerful Pokemon with no way to boost their Speed, especially Mega Pokemon, are perfect partners to capitalize off of Galvantula's Sticky Web. Mega Lucario, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Garchomp are great examples of Pokemon that really shine with Sticky Web support. Sticky Web also allows Pokemon that gain Speed upon Mega Evolving to outspeed more threats before they do so. In particular, Sticky Web has good synergy with slow, bulky boosters that fail to outspeed Choice Scarf users at +1, such as Dragonite and Gyarados, as it prevents their sweeps from being cut short by the likes of Choice Scarf Genesect and Terrakion. Swords Dance Bisharp also pairs well with Sticky Web as it becomes much less reliant on Sucker Punch and its mere presence on a team discourages Defog, as the Evasion drop will double its Attack due to its ability, Defiant. Powerful Choice Band and Choice Specs users form the final group of Pokemon that appreciate Sticky Web support.

Next, a good check to Rotom-W and physical walls / pivots in general is needed, as those are the most common answers to Talonflame.

Rotom-W can deal with most physical walls and tanks that check Talonflame, in addition to bringing Talonflame in unharmed with Volt Switch, making for a very effective teammate. Staraptor forms a very effective offensive core with Talonflame, as both Pokemon have similar checks and counters, so either of them can weaken the opposing team so that the other one can clean up later. If Staraptor holds Choice Band, Staraptor is usually the one who weakens the opposing team and Talonflame the one who sweeps, while if Staraptor holds Choice Scarf the opposite happens.

If using Magic Coat, run a Timid nature to minimize Foul Play and confusion damage, as well as max HP because there's no reason for offensive investment without an attack.

Don't do anything besides set up hazards unless absolutely required, as you never want to risk not getting up anything, which would essentially leave you playing 5-6 against the opponent with no advantage. It is also unwise to lead against teams that carry a potential Defog user or a Rapid Spin Excadrill.

In some cases, scouting will be necessary before Rhyperior can safely come in--for example, Rhyperior can easily stop Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, but bulky variants with Will-o-Wisp are much harder to deal with, and Mega Charizard Y flat-out destroys Rhyperior with Solarbeam. Therefore, before recklessly switching Rhyperior into threats, it's always a good idea to learn the opponent's sets. Once Rhyperior is safely in, Stealth Rock is great to use against foes that aren't an immediate threat. However, remember to attack when necessary--allowing an opponent to get a free turn can be extremely dangerous against foes such as Swords Dance Excadrill."}, {"Content": "Teammates that can easily take advantage of the Water- and Grass-type moves that Rhyperior lures in are prime candidates as teammates. Azumarill, Keldeo, Rotom-W, Poison Heal Breloom, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi are all Pokemon that fit the bill well, although the former three should be used alongside another teammate that can sponge Grass-type attacks, such as Mega Scizor (who can easily set up on Mega Venusaur, one of Rhyperior's number one switch-ins). Although it shares several weaknesses with Rhyperior, Tyranitar provides useful Sand support for Rhyperior, allowing Rhyperior to gain an effective special defense boost that allows it to take hits from the likes of Aegislash better. Although Rhyperior doesn't mind entry hazards very much, Rhyperior's teammates will most likely appreciate Rapid Spin or Defog support, seeing as its team will be doing a lot of switching due to Rhyperior being easily forced out. Zapdos shares decent synergy with Rhyperior, easily absorbing Grass- and Water-type attacks, as does Skarmory, as Rhyperior will easily cover for its Fire- and Electric-type weaknesses."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Leftovers"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 252, "Attack": 4, "Defense": 252, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 0}, "Natures": [10], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Stealth Rock", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earthquake", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Rock Blast", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Stone Edge", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Ice Punch", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Toxic", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Physically Defensive"}], "Name": "Rhyperior", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 5, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Lightningrod"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Reckless"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Solid Rock"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 55, "HP": 115, "Attack": 140, "Defense": 130, "SpecialDefense": 55, "Speed": 40}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Ancient Power", "Description": "10% chance to boost all stats 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aqua Tail", "Description": "No additional effect."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Attract", "Description": "Targets of the opposite gender are infatuated and have a 50% chance to do nothing."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Avalanche", "Description": "Doubles in power if damaged by the target."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Blizzard", "Description": "10% chance to freeze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Block", "Description": "The target cannot switch out."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Body Slam", "Description": "30% chance to paralyze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brick Break", "Description": "Destroys Light Screen and Reflect, then hits."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulldoze", "Description": "Lowers target's Speed by 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Captivate", "Description": "Lowers an opposite gender foe's SpA 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Chip Away", "Description": "Ignores the target's stat changes."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Counter", "Description": "If hit by a physical attack, returns double the damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Crunch", "Description": "20% chance to lower SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Crush Claw", "Description": "50% chance to lower Def 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Curse", "Description": "Does 1/4 damage per turn at the cost of half the user's max HP if the user is a Ghost.

Terrakion is an excellent partner as it can smash Tyranitar, Heatran, and Chansey with its STAB Close Combat. Bisharp is a nice offensive check to Tyranitar, and can threaten Aegislash and Chansey with Knock Off as well as deal solid damage to the latter with Pursuit. Moltres's U turn can often bring Bisharp in safely against these Pokemon. Tornadus-T can form a nice Hurricane core with Moltres and can also lure and defeat mutual checks with Superpower.

Try to set up a Substitute on Pokemon who cannot break it, such as Skarmory, or when you expect the opponent to switch out. A good scenario to use Substitute is if your Moltres is on the field against a Ferrothorn. If you're not safely behind a Substitute, it is wise to keep in mind that Toxic should nearly always be used to hit Water-types as they switch in, as they will force Moltres out otherwise. It is also important to remember that Pressure will double the PP used by moves used against Moltres, so it is feasible to stall out the PP of moves such as Stone Edge through the use of Substitute and Roost. Because Stealth Rock takes a huge 50% of HP upon switch-in, you should play cautiously when it is on the field, as using Substitute once before switching out will mean that Moltres is useful only as death fodder unless Stealth Rock is removed. Although this set is invested in Special Defense, you should recognize that Moltres's typing allows it to check physical attackers, too. Scizor and Conkeldurr can do very little outside of Knock Off.

As far as Defog users go, Latios is an excellent choice, particularly variants carrying Earthquake, as it effectively lures and removes Heatran as well as dealing nice damage to Tyranitar. In terms of a defensive core, bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Gourgeist are great partners as they can switch into Electric- and Water-type moves.

Ice Punch is a viable alternative to Earthquake if none of these threats are an issue, as it allows for Tyranitar to deal heavy damage to Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp.

Tyranitar's insane bulk makes it more than capable of switching into a plethora of non-super effective special attacks, which can consistently put a lot of pressure on offensive teams that lack a good switch-in to it.

Even some Steel-types are 2HKOed by Boomburst, including Excadrill, Mega Mawile, and Scizor, while Aegislash can only switch into Boomburst a limited number of times. However, for a more effective way of getting rid of these Pokemon, give Overheat a try. It covers Steel-types, with Aegislash being the most relevant target; with Overheat, Exploud is actually a fairly decent check to Aegislash, as it can switch in on a Shadow Ball and is immune to Aegislash's only priority attack, Shadow Sneak. Meanwhile, Focus Blast hits Rock-types, most notably Tyranitar, as well as Heatran, which is immune to Overheat. Exploud covers so much in just these three moves that the move in the fourth slot is basically just down to personal preference. Unlike Overheat, Flamethrower hits Steel-types without forcing Exploud out, while Surf is a more reliable method of dealing with Heatran and Tyranitar if the accuracy of Focus Blast is unreliable in any given situation."}, {"Content": "The item choice is rather obvious, as Choice Specs just makes Exploud so powerful. A Modest nature adds to this, and Exploud doesn't need to run a Speed boosting nature as it sits at an awkward Speed tier. However, this doesn't stop Speed investment from being useful to benefit from Sticky Web and outspeed defensive Pokemon that don't invest in their Speed stat, such as Rotom-W. The Special Attack investment is obviously in order to increase Exploud's power, while Scrappy is chosen for the ability over Soundproof as it enables Exploud to hit Ghost-types with both Boomburst and Focus Blast. Note that if you are using Exploud to receive Speed boosts from a Baton Pass user, Life Orb is a fine item choice as Exploud will have much better sweeping potential overall with the freedom to change moves."}, {"Content": "Exploud should not be used as a sweeper as it is simply too slow to sweep. Instead, Exploud is most comfortable in the role of a wallbreaker, which it pulls off effectively with the great power of Boomburst. In regard to Boomburst, even Pokemon that resist it take a hefty chunk from it, so it is a safe move to use in most situations and is definitely the move that should be used the most. Note that two consecutive Overheats are more powerful than two consecutive Flamethrowers, so it is generally better to use against Steel-types. Finally, it is incredibly important to understand that Exploud isn't that bulky, so it shouldn't try to frequently switch into attacks. Try using teammates with Volt Switch or U-turn to guarantee that it gets in safely."}, {"Content": "Partners that have some way of remedying Exploud's major flaw\u2014its poor Speed\u2014are really helpful. There are a variety of ways to do this; Sticky Web is one of the best as it easy to set up and affects the majority of Exploud's common switch-ins. Common users of the move are Smeargle and Galvantula. If the opponent has Sticky Web on their side of the field, then Exploud is able to outspeed Pokemon such as Jolly Terrakion and Timid Keldeo. If using Sticky Web, a teammate capable of defeating Bisharp, such as Keldeo or Conkeldurr, is recommended. If Sticky Web isn't your cup of tea, then another way to boost Exploud's Speed is by using it as the receiver of Speed boosts from a Pokemon with Baton Pass, Scolipede being the best example for this."}, {"Content": "U-turn and Volt Switch users can get Exploud into battle safely while retaining momentum. Landorus-T can check the physical Fighting-types that trouble Exploud, but Rotom-W and Scizor are also good choices. A physical wallbreaker is a great partner to break through the special walls that trouble Exploud. Terrakion, Mega Pinsir, and Kyurem-B are all great in this regard. In general, any team with Exploud needs a way of beating Chansey and Blissey. Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp, Aegislash, and Tyranitar are pretty good choices for beating Chansey and Blissey. Strong Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion can do the trick, as can Landorus or Landorus-T with Knock Off, which cripples Chansey severely and does a hefty amount to Blissey.

Substitute allows Kyurem to avoid status, eases prediction between Earth Power and Ice Beam, and prevents Kyurem from being revenge killed easily, which makes up for its lackluster Speed. Thanks to Kyurem's above average-defenses and ability to make 101 HP Substitutes, there are many situations where Kyurem can set up a Substitute; whether it be against fixed-damage moves such as Seismic Toss, or resisted moves which fail to break its Substitute, such as Volt Switch and Hydro Pump. When Roost is added to the equation, Substitute can be used to stall out opposing Pokemon's PP with its ability Pressure. This is especially helpful against Pokemon who have only one move that can break its Substitute, such as Ferrothorn with Gyro Ball."}, {"Content": "Despite all of its flaws, Kyurem has a massive base 130 Special Attack and great neutral coverage, along with one of the strongest Ice Beams in the tier. Ice Beam is Kyurem's best STAB attack due to its great offensive coverage and is almost mandatory on any non-hail set, in which case Blizzard should be used. Earth Power allows Kyurem to muscle past Ice-type resists, specifically Fire- and Steel-types, keeping it from being walled by the likes of Aegislash and Heatran.

Leftovers is the preferred item, as it makes Kyurem less reliant on Roost for recovery."}, {"Content": "Kyurem should be sent out on a Pokemon that is unable to break its Substitute, such as Rotom-W, or a Pokemon which can be PP stalled until it can't break its Substitute, such as Ferrothorn, or a Pokemon that is threatened by its attacks, such as Gliscor. Once Kyurem has switched in, it should use Substitute immediately, as it limits the ways that the opponent can deal with it. However, if one of its hard counters is likely to switch in, such as Suicune or Sylveon, Substitute is generally a bad choice in that situation as it will be shaving off 25% of its health for no benefit. Use this as an opportunity to double switch to a Pokemon that can take advantage of its hard counters. If an attacker with low-PP moves such as Focus Blast or Stone Edge are likely to switch in, it may be a good idea to use Substitute as they switch in, then stall them until Kyurem needs to Roost. However, Kyurem should not sacrifice health to PP stall in a position where it cannot gain that health back through Roost."}, {"Content": "Having either Rapid Spin or Defog is mandatory for Kyurem to succeed. Mandibuzz and Skarmory are your best options, as they have great synergy with Kyurem. Since Kyurem has trouble with special walls, strong physical attackers such as Pinsir and Garchomp are appreciated. Pokemon that can deal with Scizor and faster offensive Pokemon are also a great help to Kyurem. Quagsire fits this role nicely, since it also has good type synergy with Kyurem and can deal with Scizor. Since Kyurem can deal with stall, Pokemon that struggle to break though stall, such as Terrakion, appreciate Kyurem's support.

In this set, Draco Meteor is the main STAB move as it is powerful and it can be used indefinitely without repercussions. As a Water-type move, Hydro Pump in generally the best due to its power, but Surf can be used for the if Hydro Pump's poor accuracy is troubling, even though it is much weaker, especially before a boost. Finally, the last slot is dedicated to which Pokemon Kingdra want's to be able to muscle past. Agility is the main option here for when Kingdra can setup on a predicted switch, and then possibly setup on one move of the switch-in, allowing it to sweep a team with ease from that moment, though Hidden Power Fire can be used for Ferrothorn, an otherwise solid counter.

Focus Energy is the most beneficial setup move to use against defensive teams, as it allows Kingdra to hit massively hard against them, breaking through most defensive staples easily. Against faster, more offensive teams, Agility should be used to outspeed the opposing Pokemon, potentially leading to a sweep with Kingdra's STAB moves. Bear in mind that when using Agility, Kingdra will be affected by Draco Meteor's Special Attack drops, so it can't sweep as effectively against foes that resist Water. However, if you can manage to get up both boosts, Kingdra doesn't have to worry about any of the problems posed by only using one or the other. Kingdra's excellent typing allows it to switch in on Fire- and Water-type moves easily, which is especially helpful against Choice-locked attackers to allow setting up of either Focus Energy or Agility.

Scolipede is also a prime partner, as Kingdra's main flaw is its slightly sub-par Speed. Scolipede can Baton Pass Speed and Iron Defense boosts, a Substitute to ease Kingdra in setting up, and can even set up Spikes to help with Kingdra's sweep. In addition, it draws in Fire-type moves, which Kingdra can easily absorb thanks to its 4x resistance to them.

Hydro Pump is Kingdra's most powerful Water-type STAB move, as it deals massive damage to anything in the rain and is generally the preferred choice. Its shaky accuracy can be a problem, so Surf can be used as a more reliable alternative. Draco Meteor is a secondary STAB move; it is powerful, though a use of it will halt Kingdra's sweep. It is essential in breaking through bulky Water-types, and other things that resist Hydro Pump. Outrage is the main option here, as it can be used after a Draco Meteor to beat many threats that would otherwise wall you after the Special Attack drop, such as Rotom-W and Mega Venusaur. It also is great against Rotom-W and specially defensive Pokemon, but it does have a nasty side effect of locking Kingdra into it, so Rain Dance can be used instead to lessen Kingdra's reliance on Pollitoed to sweep. Waterfall is a physical Water-type STAB move that deals hefty damage to Blissey and Chansey in rain, and like Outrage, it is an excellent move to use after a Draco Meteor; it is also helpful in breaking through specially defensive Tyranitar variants. However, Surf can be used in this slot as a reliable special Water-type STAB move. Ice Beam is a handy coverage move to 2HKO Grass-type threats, including Celebi after Stealth Rock, but it is often out-damaged by Kingdra's other moves, especially in the rain, while as an alternative to Draco Meteor, Dragon Pulse is good for Water-types when the Draco Meteor Special Attack drop is undesirable; as always, the accuracy is helpful as well."}, {"Content": "Kingdra uses full Special Attack investment, as it is its most commonly used offensive stat, and 192 Speed EVs let it outrun Deoxys-S in the rain.

Kingdra sweeps best late-game after foes like Ferrothorn are removed, but if it is a win condition for you earlier in the game, go for it. With Life Orb and Kingdra's susceptibility to all entry hazards, it is wise to bring Kingdra in on a double switch or after a teammate has fainted. However, its handy 4x resistances to Fire- and Water-type moves does allow it the reassurance of being able to safely switch in on these moves."}, {"Content": "Politoed is a mandatory partner for the rain it provides, particularly for sets that don't run Rain Dance.

Magnezone and Gothitelle are great partners, as they can eliminate Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire; bear in mind that this should be done before rain is set up. Rotom-W makes for a good partner, as it can easily deal with Azumarill while also aiding Kingdra in entering the battle safely with Volt Switch. As mentioned before, Keldeo is a good partner not only because it benefits from rain, but also because it break through Blissey and Chansey. Thundurus can break through bulky Water-types with impunity, and can use U-turn to keep up momentum. Kingdra is also worn down quickly by Life Orb, so Rapid Spin or Defog support is often required to enable Kingdra to stay alive as long as possible.

Draco Meteor is mainly for blasting holes in the Pokemon that resist Water, including Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Latios, and Kyurem-B. Surf is used as your reliable STAB move for the late-game, though Scald is an option as well. While the difference between the two may seem inconsequential, Surf's higher power lends Kingdra the ability to clean through teams more easily, while Scald's burn chance is in particular really helpful for Kingdra as the burn cripples some of its best checks, such as Ferrothorn, Azumarill, and Mega Venusaur. There isn't really much that can be covered with the last slot, but Ice Beam does the most against bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Chesnaught, Dragon Pulse is another reliable STAB move which can be used against Pokemon such as Garchomp without forcing you out, and finally, Sleep Talk is an option as you have what you will need the majority of the time in the first three moveslots, so Kingdra can be used to absorb the sleep move and possibly still be able to blast through things later in the game, as rain will likely be up."}, {"Content": "With the specified EV spread, Kingdra outruns Deoxys-S in the rain, has full Special Attack investment, and saves the rest of the EVs for bulk.

Deoxys-S is another great choice, as it can setup rain quickly as well as Stealth Rock, which makes it valuable when using Kingdra on heavily hyper offense-oriented teams. On these teams, other rain sweepers are recommended, with Kabutops being one of the the best, but Ludicolo, Seismitoed, and Tornadus-T are other Pokemon that work quite well. Each offers many different advantages to your rain team: Ludicolo threatens bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Seismitoed is immune to Thundurus's priority Thunder Wave, which stops most rain sweepers cold, and Tornadus-T can use its STAB Hurricanes at full accuracy in the rain, while also being a useful pivot with U-turn, Regenerator, and its high base Speed.

Earth Power rounds out the coverage by nailing Heatran, Rotom-W, Aegislash, Bisharp, Mega Mawile, and Klefki, among various other Fire- and Steel-type foes."}, {"Content": "The HP EVs ensure you have an HP number above 404, which ensures your Substitutes are not broken by Seismic Tosses from Blissey and Chansey, allowing Kyurem-B to get a bit more Leftovers recovery before being forced out, as it cannot do much to harm either significantly. With full Speed investment, Kyurem-B at least ties opposing neutral Kyurem-B. 248 EVs would be enough for Jolly Gyarados, which you definitely want to outrun; four more EVs just provides a small benefit from time to time. The rest is dumped into Special Attack to power up Ice Beam and Earth Power. You can run a Mild nature if you'd prefer to take special hits from the likes of Manaphy a bit better, or a Rash nature if attacks from Pokemon like Gyarados are of particular concern."}, {"Content": "Getting in Kyurem-B is pretty easy; it has a number of nice resistances, including Electric, Water, and Grass, and generally has pretty good bulk. Once you get an opportunity to switch in, set up a Substitute and proceed to fire off attacks as appropriate. Kyurem-B is one of the scariest attackers in the game, period. Behind a Substitute, it's just that much more difficult to deal with. You want to err on the side of caution against possible status or Leech Seed users, as getting hit with either is extremely crippling to Kyurem-B, so definitely Substitute in those scenarios. However, don't waste them; if the opponent can simply break your Substitute after you set it up, then you've just wasted a quarter of Kyurem-B's health for nothing. It can be worth it to scout, though."}, {"Content": "As obvious as it may sound, Kyurem-B is one Pokemon you really want to preserve against defensive teams. Pokemon such as Blissey, Chansey, Clefable, and Sylveon often stand in its way; if you are patient and get rid of those Pokemon, such teams tend to be easy pickings for Kyurem-B."}, {"Content": "Defog support is a must because hazards limit Kyurem-B's longevity immensely. Because of this, Latios makes an excellent partner, forming a devastating offensive duo with Kyurem-B that can ravage opposing teams. Rapid Spin Excadrill also makes for a solid choice. Running an offensive Steel-type, such as Bisharp, Iron Head Aegislash, or Scizor, helps against pesky Clefable and Sylveon. As these Pokemon carry powerful physical attacks, they can also threaten Blissey and Chansey, meaning they can eliminate virtually all counters to this Kyurem-B. Finally, Pokemon prone to being walled by common defensive Pokemon in general, such as Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Keldeo, will love the wallbreaking support Kyurem-B provides. With their counters eliminated, it is often easy for these Pokemon to overwhelm opposing teams."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Leftovers"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 200, "HP": 56, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [14, 20], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Substitute", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Ice Beam", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Fusion Bolt", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earth Power", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Substitute Attacker"}, {"Abilities": [], "Description": [{"Content": "Ice Beam and Fusion Bolt provide Kyurem-B's staple coverage, allowing it to hit a variety of threats for solid damage even without offensive EVs.

Dragon Tail is used in the last slot as a good emergency option against boosting foes. There are a couple other options if you'd rather have a bit more coverage.

It is a great Manaphy and non-Stone Edge Gyarados check, and can take on Pokemon like Greninja, special Genesect, and Heatran quite nicely. It takes advantage of its resistances to Water, Electric, and Grass and generally solid bulk to function as a check to a variety of Pokemon. Don't get cocky with it, though, especially against foes that might carry super effective attacks. That's not what this Kyurem-B is meant to take. You shouldn't be expecting it to deal heavy damage; while Kyurem-B's power is still remarkable, it just doesn't have the wallbreaking potential of the other sets.

Sylveon, Blissey, and Chansey also laugh at this set, taking little damage from all of its attacks and attacking (Sylveon) or crippling it with Toxic (the blobs). Landorus-T, Latios, Latias, Mega Scizor, and Gliscor serve as excellent partners for this reason. Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock, which Dragon Tail can take advantage of to shuffle around and chip away at the opposing team. The others can all run Defog, which gets rid of the Stealth Rock that especially this Kyurem-B hates, as it neuters its hit-taking capabilities. Mega Scizor can take out Sylveon, which is a major plus.

Use Roar to phaze out opponents that attempt to set up on Heatran or that have already set up, as well as on predicted switches, ideally racking up entry hazard damage in the process. Taunt followed by Toxic will dispose of most stall-oriented Pokemon and support Arceus formes, though Arceus will need to be Taunted on the switch."}, {"Content": "Be wary of double switches when sending out Heatran, as it can be left in a tight situation when confronted with an opponent like Kyogre, Mega Gengar, or Mega Blaziken. Additionally, make sure Heatran is not your only check to top Pokemon such as Xerneas and Ho-Oh, as they can often KO Heatran if they run the proper coverage move."}, {"Content": "In general, good teammates are Pokemon that can compensate for Heatran's Water-, Ground-, and Fighting-type weaknesses and can take advantage of what it can do, namely setting up Stealth Rock and inflicting dangerous Pokemon with Toxic. Groudon is a particularly helpful teammate thanks to its Drought ability, removing Heatran's Water-type weakness for a select number of turns and boosting the power of its Lava Plume. Groudon can also forgo Stealth Rock and run an offensive set if Heatran has the move, luring out threats such as Kyogre and Yveltal and hitting them hard. Palkia checks Kyogre and can hit most Ground-types super effectively, while Heatran can deal with the Fairy-types that plague Palkia. Gliscor and Landorus-T are full stops to nearly every Ground- and Fighting-type, and can use U-turn to get Heatran in safely. Grass Arceus checks Kyogre and Ground-types well. Lugia and the Giratina formes can defeat most Ground- and Fighting-types bar Gliscor, though they share a nasty weakness to Yveltal with Heatran, as does Grass Arceus. Zekrom can check Yveltal and Water-types, and can use Volt Switch to get Heatran in with minimal risk.

Will-O-Wisp can be used to deal with Mega Mawile a lot easier and soften physical attacks aimed at Heatran in general; it also cripples common switch-ins to Heatran like Terrakion and Garchomp. Roar is an option to rack up entry hazard damage; it also allows you to phaze certain threats like Swords Dance Mega Mawile and Bulk Up Talonflame.

Heatran can easily tank weak Water-type attacks from bulky Water-types, so even if you can't predict their switch-in, it might be best to Toxic them regardless (as with the combination of Protect and Roar, Heatran can easily gain back health via Leftovers). Be careful when using Protect, as it can often be used as setup fodder for sweepers like Garchomp and Terrakion.

Having a solid physical wall to take on Garchomp and Terrakion is generally a good option since they often force Heatran out.

Trick gives Gardevoir the ability to cripple opposing Pokemon and is particularly useful against support-based Pokemon such as Hitmontop or Cresselia.

However, most of them can do little to Reuniclus in return and Psychic is more powerful, so is generally the preferred option. Focus Blast gets decent coverage with Psychic, hitting Psychic-immune opponents like Tyranitar for super effective damage.

Aegislash is a good choice in this regard, and excels on the bulky offense teams Reuniclus is best on. Heatran handles Scizor and Clefable nicely; it can also support the team with Stealth Rock.

However, Psyshock still can be used as it helps Reuniclus beat special walls such as Blissey. Focus Blast gets good coverage with Reuniclus's STAB move and is its strongest secondary attacking move. Shadow Ball is primarily for hitting other Psychic-types and Aegislash, which would otherwise resist all of Reuniclus's moves, for super effective damage. However, Hidden Power Fire is an option that can be used over Shadow Ball to OHKO Scizor, which is especially useful as Reuniclus outspeeds it if Trick Room is up and takes heavy damage from its STAB U-turn or Bug Bite otherwise.

Iron Tail, despite its fairly unreliable accuracy, is a necessity on Lucario's moveset - without it, it struggles to take out bulkier fairies, like Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas, even with bullet punch, also dealing major damage to ghost types that would be unaffected, as well as flying, psychic or bug types that would resist Close Combat. Bullet punch is Lucario's best bet for a priority move - again, it is adaptability boosted, allowing it to revenge important threats like a weakened Geomancy Xerneas, and finishing off any Pokemon that might outspeed it. The last slot is used for any extra coverage that Lucario may need. Stone Edge hits Ho-oh, OHKOing all but the most defensive of sets. Ice Punch hits Gliscor and Landorus-T for 4x effectiveness, both of which would otherwise resist Close Combat, as well as accurately hitting Pokemon like Giratina, Giratina-O, and Lugia for super effective damage.

Although it loses out on the useful residual damage immunity that Magic Guard brings, Trace gives Mega Alakazam an interesting niche because it allows it to use the opponent's abilities against themselves. For example, it can copy Kingdra's Swift Swim and revenge kill it, copy Heatran's Flash Fire ability to make it immune to Fire-type attacks, and copy Greninja's Protean ability so it can obtain STAB on all of its coverage moves.

With a Focus Sash, Alakazam becomes an amazing revenge killer thanks to its immunity to all forms of residual damage, which ensures that Alakazam has to be hit a minimum of two times before going down. Life Orb, on the other hand, gives it immense power that allows Alakazam to become more of a wallbreaker but comes with the price of decreased revenged killing capabilities."}, {"Content": "Whether you choose to run Focus Sash or Life Orb, the main purpose of this set is to take advantage of Alakazam's attributes in order for it to become a formidable revenge killer. Because of this, it fits best on offensive teams, as it is able to outspeed and revenge kill a large variety of Pokemon that give these teams trouble. Due to Alakazam's mediocre defenses, it is very important to only send it in on something it can OHKO, or else Alakazam becomes very vulnerable to being OHKOed in return or having its Focus Sash broken. However, as long as Focus Sash is intact, Alakazam has the ability to revenge kill Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Garchomp, and Genesect, giving it a huge advantage over other revenge killers."}, {"Content": "Alakazam appreciates being paired with Pokemon that can beat its common checks and counters. Fighting-types such as Lucario, Keldeo, and Terrakion can easily blast through Blissey, Chansey, Tyranitar, and other special walls that are able to sponge Alakazam's attacks. Breloom is an incredible offensive partner because it can check a wide range of Pokemon that give Alakazam trouble, such as Bisharp, Azumarill, Weavile, and Greninja. Aegislash can be very problematic for Alakazam, so Diggersby, Garchomp, and Landorus-T are good partners because they are able to easily tank a Shadow Sneak and destroy Aegislash with Earthquake. Entry hazard support from the likes of Skarmory and Ferrothorn can really help weaken down opposing threats so they can be revenge killed more efficiently."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Focus Sash"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Life Orb"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 252, "HP": 4, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [24], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Psyshock", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Focus Blast", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Shadow Ball", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Hidden Power Fire", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Hidden Power Ice", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Special Attacker"}], "Name": "Alakazam", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 3, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Inner Focus"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Magic Guard"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Synchronize"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 135, "HP": 55, "Attack": 50, "Defense": 45, "SpecialDefense": 95, "Speed": 120}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Ally Switch", "Description": "Switches position with another Pokemon on user's side of the field."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Attract", "Description": "Targets of the opposite gender are infatuated and have a 50% chance to do nothing."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Barrier", "Description": "Boosts Def 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Body Slam", "Description": "30% chance to paralyze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Calm Mind", "Description": "Boosts SpA and SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Captivate", "Description": "Lowers an opposite gender foe's SpA 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Charge Beam", "Description": "70% chance to boost SpA 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confusion", "Description": "10% chance to confuse."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Counter", "Description": "If hit by a physical attack, returns double the damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dazzling Gleam", "Description": "Deals damage to all adjacent foes."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Disable", "Description": "Prevents the last move used from being used again for 2-5 turns."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Double Team", "Description": "Boosts evasion 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Double-Edge", "Description": "Has 1/3 recoil."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Drain Punch", "Description": "Leeches 50% damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dream Eater", "Description": "Leeches 50% of the damage dealt.

A Fairy-type or Tyranitar is needed to check Yveltal, as although it cannot switch into Judgment easily, Yveltal easily outlasts Fighting Arceus one-on-one with Oblivion Wing. Stealth Rock is very important for Fighting Arceus, as it limits Ho-Oh considerably, guarantees a 2HKO with Judgment on Yveltal attempting to switch in, and weakens Mega Kangaskhan and Extreme Killer Arceus; Landorus-T, Tyranitar, and Dialga are good Stealth Rock users.

Grass-types such as Celebi, which resist Gastrodon's STAB moves, are targeted by Ice Beam. More importantly though, Ice Beam hits Dragons like Garchomp and Dragonite hard, allowing Gastrodon to better fulfill its role as a physical wall.

Be cautious about certain strong threats however, as Choice Band Azumarill and Dragonite can still 2HKO with Play Rough and Outrage, respectively, and similar Pokemon can do the same. Whenever possible, Recover should be used to keep Gastrodon healthy throughout the match. Ideally, Gastrodon should be switched into an expected Water-type attack in order to achieve a Special Attack boost via Storm Drain - Keldeo and Rotom-W are suitable targets here. By virtue of its typing, Gastrodon can be used to check some special attackers, notably Electric-types such as Thundurus and Magnezone that do not carry a Grass-type coverage move; though the former can break through Gastrodon with a +2 Focus Blast. If running Ice Beam, be aware that it should only be used to try to hit Grass-types such as Celebi as they switch in, as Gastrodon has no business staying in against these Pokemon. Physical Dragons such as Dragonite and Salamence are the main targets, as Gastrodon can survive any single attack from them and retaliate. The same philosophy applies with Toxic; it should nearly always be used to target incoming checks, such as Jellicent and Gourgeist, as Gastrodon can not afford to stay in against them. Finally, it is important to keep in mind that Gastrodon is very weak without any investment in Special Attack; it requires some prior damage or a Storm Drain boost to guarantee that Ice Beam KOes Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Dragonite."}, {"Content": "Gastrodon is most suited as a physical wall on defensively inclined or stall-based teams. As Grass-types are its bane, Celebi is a good partner to reliably counter Breloom. Similarly, Ferrothorn can switch into most Grass-types comfortably and set up entry hazards. As Gastrodon is susceptible to strong special attacks, pairing it with a specially bulky partner is wise. Heatran is therefore a nice teammate, as it can check the likes of Choice Specs Latios and Noivern, as well as defeating Ferrothorn. In return, Gastrodon can switch into Water-type attacks aimed at Heatran. Skarmory and Forretress make for decent partners due to their ability to set up entry hazards to wear down the opposing team. They can easily take Grass-type attacks, while Gastrodon can take Fire-type moves aimed at them and Electric-type moves too in Skarmory's case. Opposing entry hazards severely limit Gastrodon's walling capabilities, especially Toxic Spikes. As such, a Rapid Spin or Defog user makes for a useful partner. Tentacruel can remove Spikes with Rapid Spin and absorb Toxic Spikes, and Latias can remove hazards with Defog.

In conjunction with Taunt, it effectively stops all boosting threats, even if it requires Mega Banette to sacrifice itself. Taunt forces opponents to attack Mega Banette, which allows it to pull off a successful Destiny Bond, while also preventing opponents from crippling Mega Banette with status. Mega Banette's surprisingly high base 165 Attack allows it to make good use of Knock Off, dealing large amounts of damage while depriving opponents of their items. This is supportive to the team and denies Leftovers recovery, ensuring chip damage is there to stay. Protect is mostly necessary to ensure that Banette can safely Mega Evolve. Without it, Banette is unable to check the plethora of setup sweepers and other dangerous attackers it should without Mega Evolving prior in the match, which would make Banette quite inflexible. Will-O-Wisp is also an option for many reasons; not only can you use it to check physical attackers, but you can use it on free turns to further pressure the opponent and punish them for trying to get around Destiny Bond. If you opt for Will-O-Wisp over Protect, it is important to Mega Evolve early in the match, as the safety net of the latter is not available."}, {"Content": "An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs is the logical choice, as Mega Banette's role is not to take hits, and it does not require any Speed thanks to Prankster. However, Speed EVs are still needed so that Mega Banette is able to outspeed opposing priority users such as Azumarill and Scizor to be able to get them with Destiny Bond. Although moving last with Knock Off is important, minimal Speed investment is still inferior in general. Minimal investment in Mega Banette's defenses can actually be beneficial when attempting to eliminate a rather weak opponent such as Calm Mind Suicune that uses moves with secondary effects, such as Scald, Sludge Bomb, or Ice Beam. In this case, it is in Mega Banette's best interest to faint quickly and thus take its opponent with it before fainting to passive damage or becoming frozen and unable to use Destiny Bond at all. However, in a situation where the opponent is attempting to play around Mega Banette by switching around and occasionally using weak attacks to avoid Destiny Bond, it can be beneficial to be able to take hits, letting it damage the opponent more with Knock Off. In general, the HP investment is less situational. Strangely, neither fast or slow Mega Banette nor frail or bulky Mega Banette are 100% optimal, as all have their uses. As odd as it may seem, a spread that does not even use all 510 available EVs is completely viable, and natures including Brave or Lonely can be used to improve Mega Banette, in cases when one wants to outslow more opponents or be knocked out faster. Although Frisk can be replaced with the more situational Insomnia, being able to scout other Pokemon's items before Banette Mega Evolves gives the user knowledge of what set the opponent is using, and is generally the better choice."}, {"Content": "Mega Banette should be used to try and eliminate whatever threat is capable of sweeping your team. If your team is particularly weak to the likes of Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar, then Mega Banette should be preserved until late in the match, where having the opponent lose their win condition to Destiny Bond or switch out and relinquish their boosts is ideal. Because Destiny Bond is active until Mega Banette's next attack, alternation between Destiny Bond and Knock Off against faster setup sweepers almost always ensures that the opposing Pokemon will be eliminated. However, if the opponent has access to priority moves and is faster than Mega Banette, this tactic will be useless. As Mega Banette will be played to eliminate the most important member of the opponent's team, they will often try and play around Destiny Bond by switching. Alternating between Knock Off and Destiny Bond will deal damage, remove items, and force the opponent to let Mega Banette stay alive unless they want to lose a Pokemon due to Destiny Bond. With entry hazards up, this tactic is far more effective, and as such the opponent will often attempt to use recovery moves or Defog to remove the entry hazards. If the opponent sends in a Pokemon on Mega Banette that is capable of recovering or using Defog, always use Taunt, as it is a safe play and keeps pressure on the opponent. In general, if you can predict what the opponent will do, you will either take out their most important sweeper with Destiny Bond, or remove a number of items from the opponent's Pokemon, deal damage, and eventually KO something with Destiny Bond, which are both very favorable outcomes for the Banette user. Banette checks a sweeper at +1 the same as it would at +6; if you can use support moves such as Spikes, Defog, or Heal Bell while the opponent greedily boosts up higher than they need to, these end up being free turns. Mega Banette can also be used to spinblock, which is quite useful to hyper offense teams."}, {"Content": "Above all, entry hazard users are teammates that make Mega Banette far more effective. Exceptionally strong Stealth Rock users that can lay hazards with offensive pressure such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Terrakion go well with Mega Banette, as its ability to revenge kill nearly anything is very appreciated on offensive teams. Other than this, Mega Banette requires very little support to function, as it is more of a supporter itself.

It's always better to have more Trick Room turns as Bronzong won't be doing much to Ghost-types anyway."}, {"Content": "Bronzong won't need much support as it will be using Explosion after it has fulfilled its role; rather, it will be supporting its offensive teammates. Pokemon that appreciate Trick Room support, such as Ampharos, Escavalier, and Snorlax, make excellent partners, as they can use the few Trick Room turns to deal damage to or KO many Pokemon in the tier. Wish passers, especially Aromatisse as it cannot be Taunted, pair well with Bronzong if it doesn't use Explosion because they can allow Bronzong to set up Trick Room multiple times before it Explodes. Pokemon that cover Bronzong's weaknesses, such as Krookodile, Umbreon, and Hydreigon, make good partners because they have great type synergy with it, taking on the Dark-type moves that trouble Bronzong.

Weavile's main STAB move is often powerful enough to revenge weakened neutral threats, but you can also try and predict the switch-in by using a move more suited to taking down that Pokemon instead.

However, it is incompatible with Trick."}, {"Content": "One of the main selling points of Choice Scarf Chandelure is its naturally high Special Attack which means that it can hit hard without a boosting item. This gives it greater revenge killing potential and lets it clean up a weakened team more easily with one of its excellent offensive STAB moves. With good prediction, it can be used as an offensive spinblocker in a pinch, switching into Rapid Spin and threatening the opposing spinner with its powerful moves. It should also be noted that Choice Scarf Chandelure with Flash Fire is a decent check to Mega Charizard Y, a prominent threat in the metagame. It's immune to Fire Blast and Focus Blast, resists SolarBeam and does not take much damage from any other move except for Earthquake, which still fails to OHKO after Stealth Rock.

Icicle Crash is a strong secondary STAB attack that has amazing neutral coverage with Earthquake, hitting Grass- and Flying-types super effectively, while having a handy 30% flinch chance. Alternatively, Icicle Spear is an interesting option that can break through Substitute and Focus Sash users: Gliscor, Smeargle, and Breloom are relevant examples. It also has the benefit of 100% accuracy, though it is, on average, weaker than Icicle Crash. Superpower is the preferred choice in the final slot to hit the likes of Ferrothorn and Rotom-W harder than Mamoswine's STAB moves. It is also useful to hit Steel-types using Air Balloon, such as Excadrill and Heatran. Stealth Rock is an option, but it is generally set up more reliably by other variants of Mamoswine. Mamoswine also has access to Knock Off, which with its new mechanics could be useful in the final move slot if Superpower and Stealth Rock are undesired.

Outspeeding Breloom is important, as this ensures Mamoswine's Ice Shard will strike before Jolly Breloom's Mach Punch. Despite this, Adamant is viable to provide greater wallbreaking potential against Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Rotom-W in particular. As it gives a neutrality to Fire-type attacks and a resistance to Ice-type attacks, Thick Fat is the ability of choice, allowing Mamoswine to survive strong Fire-type attacks such as Choice Band Talonflame's Flare Blitz and Choice Scarf Heatran's Fire Blast. A Life Orb is ideal to maximize attacking power while retaining the versatility of switching moves, and subsequently the 29 IVs in HP minimize Life Orb recoil as well as Stealth Rock damage.

For this reason, it is always wise to preserve Mamoswine as much as is prudent during the match.

Soft-Boiled is the primary move as it is Blissey's most reliable means of recovery, and it is essential for it to wall opponents effectively. Heal Bell is used to cure its teammates of status, potentially allowing offensive Pokemon another chance to sweep, or enlarging a defensive Pokemon's lifespan by removing Toxic or burn. The third slot is dependent on what status effect you want Blissey to inflict; Toxic allows Blissey to gradually wear down special attackers, stalling them out, while Thunder Wave cripples Pokemon on the switch that Blissey can't deal with itself, especially fast physical sweepers such as Dragonite, Lucario, and Terrakion. Finally, Seismic Toss allows Blissey to break through opponents slowly but reliably, chipping away 100 HP with each use. Stealth Rock can be used as another supporting option if your team does not have a Stealth Rock user, and Blissey has ample opportunities to set it up. However, one might find that they would rather Blissey have a more offensive move to deal with certain Pokemon; for example, Flamethrower hits Forretress and Ferrothorn, which could otherwise set up entry hazards on Blissey. It can also catch Scizor and physical Genesect sets on the switch."}, {"Content": "This cleric set is most effective on stall teams and primarily defensive balanced teams, though it can be used on any team in need of a cleric. The EVs are invested in both of its defenses rather than its HP, which makes it more effective as a special wall with a marginal difference in Defense. It also limits the amount of health gained by opponents using Leech Seed. Leftovers allows for passive recovery, something that Chansey cannot even hope to have."}, {"Content": "Being a special wall, Blissey can switch in to most special attackers quite easily and either inflict a status effect on them or wear them down with Seismic Toss. Bear in mind that Latios, Latias, and Keldeo, while special attackers, have either Psyshock or Secret Sword, which are special moves that use the opponent's Defense stat in damage calculation, meaning that Blissey can not wall those Pokemon. Sometimes, it is critical to use Toxic immediately to wear down setup sweepers, as if Blissey spends its time supporting, the foe could start setting up boosts which could potentially allow it to break through Blissey. Because special attackers are unlikely to stay in on Blissey, it is an excellent idea to use either Thunder Wave or Toxic to cripple the predicted physical switch-in. If there are no special attackers left for Blissey to wall, it is generally not needed any more on the team. It might be beneficial to the team's momentum to sacrifice Blissey in a necessary situation."}, {"Content": "Being weak to physical attacks, Blissey needs teammates to cover physically attacking threats, most often physical walls; this is especially relevant on stall teams, which need Pokemon that can deal with almost all offensive threats. Skarmory forms the well-known \"SkarmBliss\" core with Blissey, with Skarmory being the physical wall of the duo. While not as effective as it used to be due to a larger amount of mixed attackers, it can still function very well with the right support. Hippowdon is a very solid physical wall; it can take on many physical attackers, phaze opponents with Whirlwind, and support the team with the sandstorm it provides. Of course, there are many other physical walls that fit well on stall teams while also covering up Blissey's weakness to Fighting-type moves: Landorus-T, Gliscor, Slowbro, and RestTalk Gyarados are a few good examples. Blissey often has trouble with physical versions of Genesect, so a Genesect check such as Heatran or Mega Charizard X is appreciated. Other stall staples that can support Blissey in some way include Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL, Trevenant, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss, as they can all check physical Fighting-types. Sableye can also check Fighting-types like Lucario, as well as other problematic Pokemon such as Reuniclus and Alakazam. Ghost-types are also solid partners, as they are completely immune to Fighting-type attacks. Some common examples include the aforementioned Sableye, Trevenant, and Gourgeist-XL, as well as Aegislash and Gengar.

The Wish itself is 357 HP, which is almost always enough to restore a teammate to its peak. The next slot can be somewhat varied depending on how you want to play. Soft-Boiled gives Blissey a reliable form of recovery immediately, and it also helps against boosting physical sweepers such as Lucario. However, Protect allows Blissey to guarantee itself to be the receiver of the Wish (except against Roar and Whirlwind) while also scouting the opponent's moves and providing itself with an extra turn of Leftovers recovery. Either of these moves are mandatory when using Wish, or Blissey can not reliably heal itself. Toxic and Seismic Toss are used to wear down the opponent; Toxic works better against defensive Pokemon while Seismic Toss is used for offensive Pokemon, as well as the Steel- and Poison-types that are immune to Toxic. Similar to the first set, Blissey can also run any number of its plentiful wealth of support options. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple fast sweepers and Stealth Rock can be used if your team is in need of it. Flamethrower is another option to deal heavy damage to Ferrothorn and Forretress."}, {"Content": "The EVs maximize both Defense and Special Defense, which allows Blissey to take on special setup sweepers such as Manaphy and Volcarona, while a Bold nature helps mitigate its terrible Defense stat.

Like the first set, Leftovers is mandatory for the passive healing."}, {"Content": "This set plays very similarly to the first set in terms of walling special attacks; it is important to remember that Blissey can't wall Keldeo, Latios, or Latias. Toxic is very detrimental to nearly all Pokemon, so if you predict a switch-in from a foe, using Toxic is a great choice. If the opponent is a Steel- or Poison-type, then Seismic Toss would be the preferred option. Wish support can often be very predictable if an important teammate is at a low level of health, so the opponent can easily switch in a check to that Pokemon. Try to predict this and switch in your own check, which could appreciate the Wish just as much as your other teammate would. Finally, bear in mind that Roar and Whirlwind now hit through Protect, so Blissey is not always guaranteed to receive its own Wish against Pokemon that can learn these moves."}, {"Content": "Again, physical walls make an effective defensive core with Blissey. Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Gliscor are common examples that can all support Blissey in some way. A teammate that can cover Blissey's Fighting-type weakness is recommended; Landorus-T, Slowbro, Trevenant, Mega Venusaur, and Sableye can all switch into these attacks with impunity, and other Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar can do the same while also threatening these opponents offensively. A Rapid Spinner is helpful for this set as it switches in to battle frequently in order to heal teammates with Wish. However, because Blissey is often used on stall or balanced teams, a Defog user is not recommended, as it will remove any entry hazards set by Blissey's own teammates. Viable Rapid Spinners that can fit well on bulkier teams include Forretress and Excadrill. Ferrothorn also makes a good partner due to its ability to check physical Dragon-types and set up its own entry hazards. Finally, a check for Keldeo, Latias, and Latios is appreciated, as they can all break through Blissey with either of Psyshock or Secret Sword, or set up in its face with Substitute and Calm Mind.

Blissey and defensive Xerneas excel at this supporting role, and Blissey helps with support Arceus weakness that Arceus Ground has. Generally, Xerneas and Ground Arceus probably will be paired together, because they create a dual immunity against Zekrom.

Extreme Speed is another excellent move to use as it packs priority to combat checks such as Greninja and can outpace other priority moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird. Finally, Stone Edge lets Entei deal decent damage to Rotom-W on the switch and demolish all the Fire-types which can easily tank a Sacred Fire bar Heatran. While Entei has great coverage with these three moves, it is still walled by Heatran; which is where Bulldoze comes in to OHKO it. However, beware of using Bulldoze, as being locked into it makes Entei setup bait for powerful sweepers such as Dragonite. Entei can use two interesting alternative moves: Hidden Power Grass and Howl. The former allows Entei to 2HKO Quagsire, which takes little damage from its other moves, but it has limited use outside of that. Howl, however, gives Entei sweeping capabilities, but it's inferior to Swords Dance Lucario as a sweeper, as Lucario also has Extreme Speed, but isn't walled as easily due to its better coverage."}, {"Content": "A Choice Band is the preferred item, as it gives Sacred Fire the raw power it needs to deal massive damage to the opposition. An Adamant nature should be used as any other nature is illegal with Extreme Speed, which is a mandatory move on Entei. A Life Orb can be used to switch between moves, but the recoil and the fact that Entei is using Sacred Fire most of the time makes it unappealing. However, with the ability to switch moves, Entei can avoid the need to predict and prevent itself from being set up bait. It also has the niche of beating Talonflame and Latios with a combination of Sacred Fire and Extreme Speed assuming they switch into Entei. Charcoal can also be used to feign Choice Band and boost the power of Sacred Fire without draining health like Life Orb does, although Entei will greatly miss a powered-up Extreme Speed and Stone Edge."}, {"Content": "Clicking the 'Sacred Fire' button is the key to using Entei to its maximum potential. Sacred Fire is an amazing move, and whenever Entei gets a chance, it should use it to spread burns and deal massive damage to the opponent. Once everything is weakened late-game, Entei can sit back and use Extreme Speed to clean up the foe's team. Spreading burns is an important objective for Entei, but using Sacred Fire as a pseudo Will-O-Wisp can lead to Entei being KOed early game. In other words, don't use Sacred Fire deliberately against checks and counters hoping for a burn, as the burn chance is not guaranteed. Entei should also play as a hit-and-run attacker if using a Choice Band as Sacred Fire and its coverage moves will force it out easily after a powerful attack. Also, Entei should use its coverage moves only when needed as they often make it set up bait to dangerous sweepers."}, {"Content": "Pokemon that can set up multiple entry hazards, such as Skarmory and Deoxys-D, are amazing partners for Entei. For example, with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, Sacred Fire 2HKOes Hippowdon, making it a bad switch-in. Entei also forces out a large amount of Pokemon, so the damage from the combination of Sacred Fire, entry hazards, and possible burn and/or sand damage will stack up very quickly."}, {"Content": "Because Entei is weak to entry hazards, a spinner such as Excadrill is highly recommended so Entei can tank hits with its great bulk throughout the match. A Defogger can be used if your team doesn't have a entry hazard setter.

In addition to that, Entei can clean up the mess that Mega Charizard Y leaves late-game with its powerful Extreme Speed. Pairing Entei with setup sweepers that have similar counters such as Mega Pinsir is highly recommended.

Entei finds many chances to switch in against the likes of Florges. Sacred Fire and Extreme Speed are the two moves that should be used the most; Sacred Fire in particular is usable even if the opponent has a Pokemon that resists it.

Stone Edge provides nice coverage in tandem with Sacred Fire, targeting opposing Fire-types such as Houndoom and Arcanine. In the final slot, Entei's best option is Flare Blitz, which can come into play if Sacred Fire's PP begins to run low and on rare occasions that extra power or perfect accuracy is required.

The EV spread is quite standard to maximize Speed and Attack."}, {"Content": "This set is quite straightforward in how it should be played. Basically, spam Sacred Fire even if the opponent has Pokemon that resist it, such as Slowbro, as a burn will often cause more damage in the long run than a coverage move.

However, Thunder Wave can be used as an alternative to Toxic if stopping opposing offensive Pokemon or Lugia's own checks and counters, such as Mega Gengar and Yveltal, is a top priority. If your team has enough Toxic users already, Thunder Wave can turn Lugia into an effective parashuffler. Whirlwind lets Lugia phaze out most sweepers foolish enough to set up in front of it, including those hiding behind a Substitute. However, Dragon Tail can be very annoying to the opposing team when combined with entry hazards and Toxic, as it adds to the residual damage, but keep in mind that Lugia cannot phaze Substitute users or Fairy-types with it. Aeroblast is Lugia's STAB move of choice, letting it defeat threats such as Mega Blaziken (2HKO), Mega Mewtwo X (2HKO), and even Mega Gengar (31.6% chance to 2HKO after Stealth Rock). On the other hand, Substitute can shield Lugia from stray Toxics and can allow it to outright wall anything that can't break it, but this comes at the cost of being complete and utter Taunt bait to faster threats such as Mega Gengar or Thundurus-I."}, {"Content": "With the above EV spread, Lugia can take on a great number of physical attackers, such as Groudon, Extreme Killer, Mega Mewtwo X, and Mega Blaziken with help of the defensive buff from Multiscale. Coupled with a Bold nature, Lugia can do decent damage with Aeroblast while taking less damage from Yveltals's Foul Play. However, an Impish nature can be used if Dragon Tail is Lugia's only attacking move in order to avoid decreasing its damage output. Lugia's two abilities, Multiscale and Pressure, let it do two different things when it comes to walling: Multiscale lets it hard check or counter most sweepers by preventing them from doing considerable damage to it, while Pressure allows Lugia to outstall most walls in conjunction with Substitute, Toxic, and Roost. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 176 Def / 84 SpD makes Lugia an effective mixed wall. Despite the specific EV spreads, Lugia's defenses are really flexible when it comes to investment, so you can invest in different stats depending on your team's needs without compromising too much of its overall bulk."}, {"Content": "First and foremost, if Multiscale is the chosen ability, be very careful when switching into Stealth Rock. Try to keep Stealth Rock off of your side of the field so that Multiscale and by extension, Lugia's walling capabilities, remain intact. Also, be extremely careful of possible Toxic users such as Landorus-T, Groudon, and Yveltal, as Lugia absolutely hates status ailments of any kind, so switch into these threats at your own peril. However, when on the field, be very generous when using Toxic or Substitute, as crippling switch-ins or warding against status conditions can be very beneficial to Lugia's overall effectiveness and longevity. Take advantage of predicted switches to come in on possible setup sweepers such as boosting variants of Xerneas or Extreme Killer, as forcing them into a corner with Whirlwind can keep your team safe and maintain your offensive or defensive momentum."}, {"Content": "Clerics are beneficial teammates as they can alleviate the status conditions that Lugia despises. The primary examples are Aromatherapy Xerneas and Sylveon, as they can remove Lugia's status conditions and deter Dark-types from switching in with a Fairy Aura-boosted Moonblast and Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice, respectively. Stealth Rock presents a large problem to Lugia, so it appreciates teammates such as Giratina and Arceus formes that can provide Defog support, burn opposing Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp, and utilize other support moves. Hazards are integral to Lugia's ability to pressure the opponent with phazing moves, so hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Klefki, Forretress, Landorus-T, and Dialga pair nicely with it. Natural teammates for Lugia are Pokemon that benefit from it crippling opposing walls with Toxic. Swords Dance Rayquaza and Kyurem-W are great offensive partners to Lugia as they appreciate having opposing walls weakened and offensive threats deterred. Furthermore, they can defeat the Steel-types that trouble Lugia with relative ease. Groudon can assist Lugia by fending off Zekrom and Tyranitar while setting up Stealth Rock. Fighting Arceus can take on a good deal of Dark-types by itself, including Darkrai, Tyranitar, and Dark Arceus, while also checking Kyurem-W. Yveltal can deal with Mega Gengar, defeat opposing walls with Taunt, and break past most Steel-types with a Dark Aura-boosted Dark Pulse. Finally, Palkia can reliably defeat Kyogre, fell most Steel-types with Fire Blast, and take down or cripple Yveltal with Thunder."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Leftovers"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 248, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 252, "SpecialDefense": 8, "Speed": 0}, "Natures": [2, 10], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Roost", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Thunder Wave", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Toxic", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dragon Tail", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Whirlwind", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aeroblast", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Substitute", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "The Great Wall"}], "Name": "Lugia", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 0, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Multiscale"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Pressure"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 90, "HP": 106, "Attack": 90, "Defense": 130, "SpecialDefense": 154, "Speed": 110}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aerial Ace", "Description": "Ignores accuracy modifiers."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aeroblast", "Description": "High critical hit rate."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Air Cutter", "Description": "High critical hit rate."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Ancient Power", "Description": "10% chance to boost all stats 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aqua Tail", "Description": "No additional effect."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Avalanche", "Description": "Doubles in power if damaged by the target."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Blizzard", "Description": "10% chance to freeze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Body Slam", "Description": "30% chance to paralyze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brine", "Description": "Base Power doubles if foe's HP is 50% or less."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulldoze", "Description": "Lowers target's Speed by 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Calm Mind", "Description": "Boosts SpA and SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Charge Beam", "Description": "70% chance to boost SpA 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Defog", "Description": "Lowers target's evasion 1 stage.

Wish and Protect go hand-in-hand so that Umbreon can simultaneously support the team and have reliable recovery. Wish is especially helpful when using defensive Pokemon or tanks that lack recovery of their own such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, Landorus-T, Rotom-W, Tentacruel, and Aegislash. Protect is also helpful on its own to check for Trick, scout for the attack of Choice users, and stall for Leftovers recovery. Heal Bell rids the team of all status, helping sweepers crippled by burn or paralysis as well as walls affected by Toxic. Foul Play is very important, heavily damaging many physical attackers hoping to switch into Umbreon, as well as the Psychic- and Ghost-types that it walls. While these four moves are almost always the best options, a few other moves are usable. Baton Pass can be used to allow Umbreon to use Wish, take a hit and switch to a Pokemon to be healed, keeping up momentum. Toxic can hurt many defensive Pokemon that don't care about Foul Play. Moonlight can work as semi-reliable recovery if your team does not need Wish support. Yawn is also an option to force switches. If you choose to use Baton Pass, Toxic, or Yawn, they should be used over Heal Bell, as Foul Play and recovery are essential."}, {"Content": "A specially defensive spread is preferred as Umbreon's set of resistances lends it to special walling, while Fighting- and Bug-type moves are common on physical attackers. Leftovers is especially nice because with Wish and Protect, Umbreon will get back more than 50% with each cycle. Inner Focus is very situational in comparison to Synchronize, so Synchronize is superior."}, {"Content": "Umbreon is best used on balanced teams that want a wall that can offer team support and be a good counter to a wide variety of Pokemon while keeping pressure with Foul Play. It's important to be conservative with Foul Play if your opponent has a Terrakion, though. If you're not sure what to do, Wish is a good way to keep momentum as it can allow your other Pokemon to switch into strong attackers without being crippled. Although it is a special wall, Umbreon is not scared of many physical attackers, in particular non-STAB U-turns, so don't be afraid to stay in on them. Use Wish often, as Umbreon is slow and something will usually appreciate the recovery. Umbreon is also a great way to deal with Aegislash, as even a Choice Band-boosted Sacred Sword will never OHKO and Foul Play will deal heavy damage and is not affected by King's Shield's Attack drops"}, {"Content": "Sturdy physical walls such as Skarmory, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon to take on Fighting-types are good partners, because Umbreon will give those Fighting-types ample switch-in opportunities. Conkeldurr is a great fit on the balanced teams that Umbreon thrives on and appreciates the Wish support. If Scizor gets in on Umbreon safely, something needs to be able to take the U-turn. Heatran, Gyarados, and Landorus-T are all good choices that also appreciate Wish support. Fairy-type Pokemon also have an easy time switching into Umbreon, so a Poison- or Steel-type is appreciated. Aegislash has good synergy with Umbreon and appreciates the support to improve its longevity. Mega Venusaur also enjoys the Heal Bell support as it is commonly afflicted by a burn and can handle many Fairy- and Fighting-types like Sylveon, Conkeldurr, and Keldeo.

Protect is a move you should only use if you opt for Wish over Moonlight, but it does have the utility of scouting for the ever-present Choice Fighting-types that roam UU. Heal Bell relieves Umbreon and its teammates of status conditions and works fantastically with Synchronize, allowing Umbreon to act as a very effective status deterrent and sponge.

Sludge Bomb is a strong STAB attack that 2HKOes many offensive Pokemon. Giga Drain is also a great move, getting good coverage with Sludge Bomb, and it hits many of the Pokemon Mega Venusaur handles like Manaphy and Rotom-W. Power Whip can be used instead for more power, but Venusaur is often burned because of Rotom-W, so it's not reliable. Leech Seed gets chip damage and a little bit of recovery from everything that is not a Grass-type, and most Grass-types don't switch in in fear of Sludge Bomb. However, Earthquake hits Heatran, a common switch in, very hard, as well as other Steel-types like Aegislash and Bisharp. Hidden Power Fire can used for Scizor, Forretress, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn as well.Mega Venusaur also has a few other support moves that it can use. Sleep Powder will cripple one Pokemon for a few turns and can take out an important Mega Venusaur check of theirs. Roar will phaze out set up sweepers, and can rack up hazard damge. Knock Off will annoy almost every Pokemon and can be used to disrupt more. If these alternate moves are used, they should go in the fourth slot, as the other three are generally essential."}, {"Content": "The EVs give Mega Venusuar great mixed bulk.

If Mega Venusaur is Bold, then 16 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed max Speed Mega Mawile and Azumarill. The EVs can be customized to your needs, since there are no vital benchmarks for Mega Venusaur."}, {"Content": "Try to Mega Evolve early so that Mega Venusaur can act as a tank all game. Talonflame and Mega Pinsir can try to set up on you, so it is important to keep pressure on them. Sludge Bomb does great damage to them on the switch. If you're unsure what a Pokemon is going to attack you with, Synthesis can be used to scout them Mega Venusaur is almost never OHKOed. Don't do this against set up sweepers, though. Mega Venusaur should use Synthesis often, since it is worn down by hazards easily, and it takes a lot of hits."}, {"Content": "Rotom-W is a good partner to take on all of the Flying-types that give Mega Venusuar trouble. Aegislash is also a good one that deals with most Psychic-types. Heatran has great synergy with Mega Venusaur and walls attackers that Mega Venusaur can't.

Note that Mega Aggron lacks any form of healing outside of Wish support, so careless switching should be avoided. If hazards are up, it's probably not a good idea to switch Mega Aggron into a potential U-turn, unless you have no choice. That being said, don't make the mistake of using Mega Aggron conservatively.

By choosing Earthquake, you prevent the likes of Aegislash, Excadrill, and Heatran from freely switching into Mega Aggron and setting up all over it, so you don't have to worry about these Pokemon as much (in fact, Mega Aggron can even check Aegislash in a pinch).

Togekiss functions similarly as a partner to Mega Aggron, with the added benefit of being immune to Ground-type attacks and being able to spread paralysis.

However, Rest provides a much more thorough form of recovery than Pain Split, particularly in removing the effects of Toxic, at the cost of practically forcing Rotom-H to carry Chesto Berry (and therefore only working reliably one time). However, it is possible to run a second status move in place of the recovery slot.

The durability of this Rotom-H makes it very easy for attackers to incur hazard damage over the course of a match. Furthermore, prediction against incoming switch-ins is key with this Rotom-H: a timely burn or a smart Volt Switch can easily turn the tide of a battle in your favor.

Some key benchmarks to keep note of is that Clefable must have two boosts to OHKO Latias, Assault Vest Conkeldurr, and Mandibuzz. Soft-Boiled is absolutely necessary to keep replenishing Clefable's health in between setup. Flamethrower does well in damaging most Steel-types; for instance, after a single boost, it OHKOes Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. On the other hand, Stored Power compensates where Moonblast is lacking by easily shattering Heatran, Chansey, and Mega Venusaur, as well as opposing Unaware users, due to its mechanics."}, {"Content": "The key to this set's success is Magic Guard. With this ability, Clefable is completely uninhibited by status moves, allowing it to boost in the face of weak walls such as Chansey and Quagsire. In light of other possibilities, Clefable is able to use Magic Guard in tandem with Soft-Boiled, thus lessening the need for more convoluted healing methods, such as Wish + Protect. Moreover, Magic Guard's utility opens the floodgate of options by allowing Clefable to utilize items such as Life Orb without being subjugated to nasty recoil."}, {"Content": "While Life Orb might seem like a strange choice, the fact that Clefable is impervious to passive damage via Magic Guard along with its access to reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled lessens the need for Leftovers. When its attacks are boosted by a Life Orb, Clefable is able to achieve KOs it wouldn't have otherwise, such as on Latias and Conkeldurr at +1 with Moonblast. With a Life Orb, Clefable also has a better chance to come out on top versus Chansey, making it a very effective stallbreaker. On the flip-side, Leftovers makes it easier for Clefable to continually set up Calm Mind boosts boosts; this is especially useful when Clefable is up against more offensively inclined teams."}, {"Content": "This set is fairly straightforward and easy to use: have Clefable come in on a weak wall such as Rotom-W, Mandibuzz, or Chansey, and from there, it can set up Calm Mind against these threats with no concern. It's good, however, to dispose of Whirlwind and/or Roar users and remove Heatran before attempting to do this, as all these threats keep Clefable in line so long as they're healthy. As far as teams to use this Clefable on, it best fits on almost any team in need of a stallbreaker or a generally good sweeper. Do keep in mind that one of this Clefable's primary purposes is to take out stall, so it's best not to force it to assume the role of a wall itself; be cautious if you attempt to switch it into more powerful physical attackers such as Garchomp and Terrakion."}, {"Content": "Forcing a switch on the likes of Dragonite or doing the above is usually the best way to get off a Calm Mind boost or two. Keep this in mind: don't get too greedy with boosts. Having Clefable accumulate too many boosts increases the odds of a critical hit occurring, which ends up only wasting turns and time, and ultimately puts you in a bad position if Clefable is taken out this way. Oftentimes, teams carry multiple checks to Clefable, most of them being Fire-weak Steel-types.

While Keldeo and Quagsire do indeed have good synergy with Clefable, Heatran and Bisharp are unlikely to stay in on them; as such, it's better to pair Clefable with a Pokemon that lures out both of these threats and nails them on the switch.

Heal Bell allows Clefable to act as a reliable cleric; therefore, it permits Clefable's offensive teammates to play a bit more aggressively, as the threat of status is watered down to a significant degree.

Just be wary that many of Clefable's common switch-ins are completely unfazed by Toxic, as they are either Poison- or Steel-types. Moonlight is an option over Wish + Protect so that Clefable acquires an extra moveslot to support its teammates, although the low PP and dilution under sandstorm makes this move a rather high opportunity cost, especially when taking into account that this Clefable needs all the PP it can get when it's up against opposing stall teams. Lastly, Calm Mind is also viable as it gives Clefable the capability to overpower bulky setup sweepers such as Manaphy and opposing Calm Mind Clefable."}, {"Content": "The set is geared more towards physical defense, as it allows Clefable to better deal with the likes of Garchomp and Terrakion. Should your team have a proper way of dealing with boosting sweepers, Clefable may forgo Unaware in exchange for Magic Guard.

Magic Guard also gives Clefable more flexibility in its moveslots, as it can now run Soft-Boiled for recovery, giving it an extra moveslot to support its teammates with or utilize a coverage move such as Flamethrower. Do note, however, that the entire allure towards using defensive Clefable is to remove the threat of setup sweepers; you'll find that by forgoing Unaware, not only does Clefable lose the ability to counter Pokemon it's supposed to, but its sheer passiveness allows a multitude of bulky threats to set up on it."}, {"Content": "A specially defensive spread is a viable alternative, as it allows Clefable to hard counter Greninja, all variants of Nasty Plot Thundurus, and Tail Glow Manaphy while still having enough bulk to comfortably wall the likes of Conkeldurr and better deal with Keldeo, Sludge Wave-less Landorus, and Life Orb Deoxys-S. The only issue with such a spread is that Clefable struggles to tank physical attacks, thus reducing the overall pool of Pokemon it normally beats. In particular, Garchomp's Earthquake and Latios's Psyshock will do a sizable chunk, so much so that Clefable should only switch in with the utmost prudence."}, {"Content": "Defensive Clefable best fits on balanced or stall teams in need of cleric and/or Wish support.

Clefable is best brought out to check the above threats, and may be done so at nearly any moment of the match."}, {"Content": "When up against offensive teams, Clefable is able to force many switches; as such, this is the best time to fire off a Thunder Wave to cripple the opposing switch-in or lay Stealth Rock on the field. Keep in mind that if Clefable's health is around 50% upon switching into a certain threat, then it's better to simply recover at that moment so that Clefable can continue to check the Pokemon in question. Also, due to its low PP, Heal Bell is to be used sparingly, especially when up against opposing stall teams where the cleric's role is invaluable in winning the status war. It's good to keep in mind, however, that unlike Heal Bell, it's advisable for Clefable to use Protect to scout for certain coverage options such as Iron Head from Kyurem-B, or accumulate Leftovers recovery in order to avoid a possible 2HKO from Terrakion's Life Orb-boosted Stone Edge, among other attacks."}, {"Content": "In terms of defensive partners, Clefable works quite well with the following: Mega Venusaur, Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T. Clefable provides Heal Bell support to all four, which is much appreciated given that the above Pokemon detest burns; in return, Quagsire, Landorus-T, and Hippodown help check Steel-types such as Heatran, Excadrill, Mega Scizor, and Bisharp, whereas Mega Venusaur easily deals with Keldeo and some of the previously mentioned Steel-types."}, {"Content": "More offensively inclined partners include Mega Medicham, Mega Gyarados, and Conkeldurr.

Just like Mega Medicham, Conkeldurr also helps deal with Steel-types, but it also takes down Gengar thanks to its meaty defenses and Guts ability, which allow it to easily tank a Shadow Ball and take advantage of Will-O-Wisp.

Excadrill's excellent typing gives it plenty of opportunities to switch in and use Rapid Spin, so feel free to use Pokemon that draw in opposing Pokemon that are vulnerable it. Excadrill will generally only be able to act once per switch in, and will sometimes have to make a hard choice between using Rapid Spin, setting up Stealth Rock, and outright attacking. Using Rapid Spin is generally the best option, though the choice of move is entirely up to you. The most important thing is to avoid being predictable."}, {"Content": "Rotom-W is a useful partner for Excadrill as it can cover most of Excadrill's weaknesses and beat most of its counters. Garchomp and Tyranitar can lure and take out Excadrill's checks and counters with their secondary sets (mixed sets from Tyranitar and Mega Garchomp, respectfully). You should make the most out of Excadrill's ability to consistently use Rapid Spin by pairing it with powerful Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock.

The effectiveness of Iron Head and Rock Slide as coverage moves is noticeably enhanced by the Life Orb boost. In particular, Excadrill is capable of 3HKOing Mandibuzz with Life Orb (which is relevant if Rock Slide flinches Mandibuzz). The last slot determines how this set is played. If Swords Dance is used, Excadrill gains the ability to break through sturdier Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and sweep entire teams outright.

After setting up sandstorm, it's imperative to bring in Excadrill as early as possible to maximize the amount of time Sand Rush is active. However, don't make the mistake of playing recklessly; if your opponent has a strong Excadrill counter and you don't need to use Rapid Spin, it's best to keep Excadrill away from battle, even if it means wasting turns that sand is in play. This variant of Excadrill can be used as a revenge killer or late-game sweeper depending on the state of the match. Swords Dance Excadrill should look for a setup opportunity to break walls or cores. That said, until you find a clear opportunity to set up, it's best to just attack whenever possible, as Life Orb-boosted Earthquakes deal significant damage. Attacking on the switch to weaken checks is also encouraged.

Mega Pinsir, Bulk Up Talonflame, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Volcarona are also good partners for the same reasons. Keldeo is a good partner for this set because it can easily deal with the Dark-types that often switch in on Espeon. Terrakion is similar in this regard and loves getting a Justified boost when it switches into a Dark-type move. Bisharp is a good option, as it appreciates easier setup opportunities and deters opponents from using Defog to remove Espeon's screens."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Light Clay"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 252, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 4, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [24], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Light Screen", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Reflect", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Baton Pass", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Psychic", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Yawn", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Dual Screens"}], "Name": "Espeon", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 1, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Magic Bounce"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Synchronize"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 130, "HP": 65, "Attack": 65, "Defense": 60, "SpecialDefense": 95, "Speed": 110}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Attract", "Description": "Targets of the opposite gender are infatuated and have a 50% chance to do nothing."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Baby-Doll Eyes", "Description": "Lowers the target's Attack by 1 stage.

These threats include naturally fast Pokemon, Choice Scarf users, and special walls. When bringing Omastar in, Weak Armor variants can gain a free Speed boost from taking physical hits, so switching it in on resisted physical moves will give Omastar a slight edge. One of the most common threats in the metagame, Talonflame, is also incredibly easy to set up on, as Omastar 4x resists its Flare Blitz. However, keep in mind that Choice Band Talonflame can 2HKO Omastar with a priority Brave Bird. Finally, if Omastar is brought in a little early, it can try to use an attack instead of setting up to damage a check on the switch and then immediately switch out, but this is quite a risky tactic."}, {"Content": "A Fire-type teammate such as Heatran or Charizard is extremely useful for getting rid of Ferrothorn, which completely counters Omastar, though any teammate with a Fire-type move will also suffice. An entry hazard setter is useful for any sweeper to turn quite a few 2HKOs into OHKOs, and Omastar is no exception. Omastar has lots of trouble with special walls, so having a strong physical attacker like Talonflame is useful for getting rid of them. Talonflame is also able to get rid of Mega Venusaur, which is arguably Omastar's best and most common counter, with Brave Bird. Many top-tier special walls, such as Blissey, Chansey, and Tyranitar, are weak to Fighting-type moves, so having a Fighting-type in your team, such as Conkeldurr or Breloom will greatly help Omastar pull off a successful sweep.

Because Ground-types love to switch into Magnezone, locking yourself into Volt Switch or Thunderbolt isn't often a good idea if the opponent has a Ground-type. However, this problem can be somewhat dealt with by good prediction, as most Ground-types hate switching into Magnezone's other moves. For example, Excadrill has a small chance of being OHKOed by Hidden Power Fire on the switch. Similarly, Flash Cannon has a chance of OHKOing Landorus-T and Gliscor on the switch after Stealth Rock. As this set's main targets are Steel-types, they are the Pokemon Magnezone should be switching in on most often.

Alternatively, a recovery move is also an option. Synthesis can heal Shaymin, and it is much more reliable now that weather isn't nearly as prevalent as it once was. However, Rest is an alternative for healing Shaymin to full health, and with its ability, Natural Cure, Shaymin will awaken immediately after switching out. Finally, an alternative Hidden Power type can be used over Hidden Power Rock. Hidden Power Ice can be used for hitting Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Dragonite (after Stealth Rock), while Hidden Power Fire can effortlessly dispose of Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Forretress. These two options all come with the very annoying side effect of preventing Shaymin from using Hidden Power Rock, so only use one of these moves if the aforementioned threats are serious problems for your team."}, {"Content": "As Shaymin's goal is to weaken Pokemon with its wide array of coverage moves, a Modest nature is recommended, as with 252 Special Attack EVs, it allows Shaymin to reach its absolute peak in offensive capability. With 216 Speed EVs, Shaymin will be faster than Kyurem-B running a Mild or a Rash nature; this means that it is will be able to use Dazzling Gleam a second time after hitting Kyurem-B with it on the switch-in, resulting in a 2HKO. The rest of the EVs\u201440 to be exact\u2014are put into Shaymin's HP stat to help it take hits better. Life Orb is the necessary item in order for Shaymin to maintain its high power while also not restricting it from changing moves. However, it is by no means compulsory; Leftovers is an option in order to increase Shaymin's longevity, but it makes Shaymin quite weak; specifically, it can not 2HKO Mega Venusaur with Psychic. As an alternative way of distributing Shaymin's EVs, maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Shaymin to Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon while also outspeeding positive-natured base 85 to 99 Speed Pokemon, something that Shaymin cannot do with the alternate EV spread."}, {"Content": "The role that Shaymin takes on the team is that of a powerful attacker, not a sweeper, so it is not wise to save Shaymin until the late-game as it is simply too slow to sweep. Many of the threats that Shaymin can take down, such as Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, Kyurem-B, Mega Venusaur, and Mandibuzz, can only be eliminated if Shaymin hits them on the switch with the appropriate coverage move. This means that using Shaymin requires a lot of heavy prediction in order to succeed. When predicting a switch-in that Shaymin cannot 2HKO with any of its moves, just use Seed Flare, as there is a reasonable chance that you it will get a Special Defense drop, which could potentially allow Shaymin to break through the opponent on a second hit instead of being forced to switch out."}, {"Content": "An excellent partner to Shaymin is Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo, as it can set up with Substitute and Calm Mind on many of Shaymin's counters and then KO them with Secret Sword; it can also break through Kyurem-B with Secret Sword and Skarmory with Hydro Pump after only one Calm Mind boost. Tyranitar can trap Latias and Latios with Pursuit and take on Blissey and Chansey with its powerful physical STAB moves. Terrakion can also easily OHKO Chansey and Blissey with its STAB Close Combat, as well as being able to prevent Volcarona from setting up on Shaymin. Heatran has great synergy with Shaymin, fits well into a Fire / Water / Grass core with Keldeo, and can counter Talonflame, one of Shaymin's biggest checks. With Stealth Rock on the field, Shaymin can 2HKO Mandibuzz on the switch, which it couldn't without. It also wards off Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Charizard Y switch-ins, which is great for Shaymin. Excadrill can set up Stealth Rock and also provide Rapid Spin support and has good defensive synergy with Shaymin. With a Life Orb, residual damage stacks up quickly, so a means of entry hazard removal is great, but a Defog user will remove hazards set by Shaymin's teammates, so it is best to use Rapid Spin instead. Starmie also has great coverage and can fit into a Fire / Water / Grass core as well."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Life Orb"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 252,

However, it fails to OHKO Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn even at +1, and so is generally inferior to Fire Blast."}, {"Content": "A Naive nature ensures maximum Speed without reducing the power of Fire Blast. If Fire Fang is used instead, a Jolly nature is ideal. The item choice comes down to personal preference. A Lum Berry gives Salamence insurance against status, allowing it to set up a Dragon Dance on the likes of Rotom-W and Jellicent, and can cure confusion induced by Outrage. On the other hand, a Life Orb provides greater attacking power and ensures that Salamence can OHKO defensive Skarmory and Ferrothorn with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock. Intimidate is preferred, as it can potentially grant more opportunities to set up a Dragon Dance, as well as weaken opposing Pokemon. Moxie is an option if the extra Attack boosts are appealing; however, Salamence often cannot defeat its checks even at +1 or +2."}, {"Content": "Salamence's role is to attempt a late game sweep, or to weaken opposing walls to allow a teammate to sweep more easily. If using Lum Berry, Salamence can safely set up Dragon Dance against opposing status inducers, as long as they are not Pokemon with Prankster. Naturally, only set up in this situation if you are sure that Salamence can KO the status user on the next turn. Life Orb sets are more suited to wallbreaking, especially when facing more defensive teams. Be wary of your opponent baiting you to lock Salamence in with Outrage; it is wise to avoid immediately selecting Outrage if your opponent has a healthy Fairy- or Steel-type remaining. If Salamence is locked into Outrage and not confused, any Fairy-type can easily revenge kill it. Remember, with Intimidate, Salamence can provide useful team support in the event that it is less effective against the opposing team, or if it has been crippled by status. As such, it can occasionally be a good idea to preserve Salamence in order to weaken opposing physical sweepers. Be cautious about using Salamence's Intimidate against Defiant users, particularly Bisharp, which will have their Attack boosted to +1 rather than dropped to -1."}, {"Content": "Salamence is best suited to offensive teams with partners that can weaken each others' checks. Lucario, Mega Charizard X, and Scizor appreciate the opposing physical walls being weakened or removed, and in turn can weaken walls for Salamence. Entry hazard support is very useful; for example, two layers of Spikes give Lum Berry variants an 87% chance to OHKO 252 / 48 Ferrothorn with Fire Blast, making offensive Spikers such as Deoxys-S and Greninja good partners. Similarly, Salamence's weakness to Stealth Rock means that Rapid Spin support is appreciated; Defog is usually not optimal as it removes all hazards, and Salamence really needs them on the opponent's side of the field. Excadrill is an excellent spinner which can lay down Stealth Rock as well as threaten Fairy-types with Iron Head. Starmie is also a good Rapid Spin user; in addition, it is a nice check to Mamoswine."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Life Orb"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Lum Berry"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 4, "HP": 0, "Attack": 252, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [16], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dragon Dance", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dragon Claw", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Outrage", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earthquake", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Fire Blast", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Dragon Dance"}], "Name": "Salamence", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 2, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Intimidate"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Moxie"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 110, "HP": 95, "Attack": 135, "Defense": 80, "SpecialDefense": 80, "Speed": 100}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aerial Ace", "Description": "Ignores accuracy modifiers."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Air Cutter", "Description": "High critical hit rate."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aqua Tail", "Description": "No additional effect."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Attract", "Description": "Targets of the opposite gender are infatuated and have a 50% chance to do nothing."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bite", "Description": "10% chance to flinch."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Body Slam", "Description": "30% chance to paralyze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brick Break", "Description": "Destroys Light Screen and Reflect, then hits."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulldoze", "Description": "Lowers target's Speed by 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Captivate", "Description": "Lowers an opposite gender foe's SpA 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Crunch", "Description": "20% chance to lower SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Cut", "Description": "No additional effect."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Defense Curl", "Description": "Boosts Def 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Defog", "Description": "Lowers target's evasion 1 stage.

This means that it can be used as a standalone set, but works best with Pokemon that appreciate the provided support. Surf is Slowbro's strongest Water-type move and its basic offensive move. Together with Surf, Ice Beam and Fire Blast round off the coverage, leaving Slowbro only unable to break through bulky Water-types. The former is used to hit Grass- and Dragon-type super effectively, while the latter provides a way for Slowbro to roast Genesect, Scizor, and Ferrothorn. However, if hitting these Pokemon with Fire Blast for super effective damage is unnecessary, Psyshock can be placed in the final slot to operate as a secondary STAB move. Psyshock also comes with the benefit of hitting specially defensive walls on their lower defensive stat, as well as hitting Mega Venusaur which can otherwise fully counter it."}, {"Content": "Through the use of a Life Orb, Slowbro's low starting power is enhanced, and it doesn't need to worry about the recoil due to Regenerator healing excess damage that it might have incurred.

Finally, because Slowbro is using Trick Room, a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to minimize its Speed under such conditions, allowing Slowbro to move before almost all OU threats when it is under Trick Room."}, {"Content": "Offensive Trick Room Slowbro is a Pokemon which can be used at virtually any point of a match, but excels late-game when it can clean up teams that its own team has already broken down. However, thanks to a spectacular ability in Regenerator, Slowbro can act as a pivot by constantly jumping in and out of the fray to set up Trick Room. This means it is best to use Slowbro more conservatively than other Pokemon, only attacking when necessary and after Trick Room has been activated. Furthermore, Slowbro can take advantage of Regenerator's passive healing through double switching so that it can be preserved for later. In the event that opponents attempt to prevent Slowbro from activating Trick Room through the use of Taunt, it is best to attack immediately and exploit Slowbro's surprising power."}, {"Content": "Slow, hard hitters which appreciate Trick Room support always enjoy being paired with Slowbro.

Slack Off is a bread-and-butter move for a wall that should be used to keep Slowbro healthy throughout the game.

The latter option is best suited for teams that have enough bulk to stall out the Pokemon that Slowbro poisons.

Full investment is placed into Slowbro's HP and Defense EVs in tandem with a Bold nature to maximize its physical bulk in order to fulfill its role as a wall. In terms of abilities, Regenerator is Slowbro's best bet and is a great ability for a wall, providing it with a form passive healing just by switching out.

Taunt can accomplish a similar feat, and works better on slower entry hazard setters like Groudon as they do not carry Magic Coat to stop the Taunt. Hidden Power Fire is an option that allows Deoxys to deal heavy damage to entry hazard setters rather than keeping their hazards away. It brings Forretress down to Sturdy and 2HKOs Ferrothorn, while also having a high chance to OHKO physically Defensive Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock damage, which can be a good lure as Bullet Punch from Scizor is unable to OHKO Deoxys."}, {"Content": "Deoxys has to be as fast as possible, so run 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature. Timid does not cause any harm to Deoxys's already pitiful defenses and since no physical attacks are being used, Timid is the best choice. Maximise Special Attack to get the most from Psycho Boost and Hidden Power Fire, and add the rest to HP. Focus Sash means Deoxys is guaranteed to get up at least one layer of entry hazards."}, {"Content": "This Deoxys set is rather easy to use. Lead with it and aim to Taunt opposing leads or possible set up sweepers, or get up Stealth Rock first, then possibly Spikes should the opponent offer no resistance. If you think Deoxys is about to go down, Psycho Boost the enemy."}, {"Content": "Firstly, the use of Deoxys is highly discouraged due to its lack of advantages over Deoxys-Attack or Deoxys-Speed, so if you wish to have a more viable option, choose Deoxys-Attack or Speed. Should you choose to run Deoxys however, it doesn't tend to need support, as it tends to be the one that's giving it. Instead opt to have teammates that can benefit from entry hazards to ensure a sweep, such as Mega Blaziken or Extremekiller Arceus. Deoxys suits Hyper Offensive teams very well as an entry hazard setter that can also provide great offensive pressure. Mega Gengar is great to stop the opponent using Defog to remove Deoxys's entry hazards, as it can trap them, Taunt them or just eliminate them. An answer to Yveltal is necessary on teams with Deoxys leads, as it's immune to Psycho Boost and takes little damage from Hidden Power Fire. Yveltal can also Taunt Deoxys, leaving Deoxys with no options but to switch out."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Focus Sash"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 252, "HP": 4, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [24], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Psycho Boost", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Stealth Rock", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Spikes", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Hidden Power Fire", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Magic Coat", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Taunt", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Useless"}], "Name": "Deoxys", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 0, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Pressure"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 150, "HP": 50, "Attack": 150, "Defense": 50, "SpecialDefense": 50, "Speed": 150}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aerial Ace", "Description": "Ignores accuracy modifiers."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Agility", "Description": "Boosts Spe 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Ally Switch", "Description": "Switches position with another Pokemon on user's side of the field."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Amnesia", "Description": "Boosts SpD 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Avalanche", "Description": "Doubles in power if damaged by the target."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bind", "Description": "Prevents the opponent from attacking for 2-5 turns."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Body Slam", "Description": "30% chance to paralyze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brick Break", "Description": "Destroys Light Screen and Reflect, then hits."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Calm Mind", "Description": "Boosts SpA and SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Charge Beam", "Description": "70% chance to boost SpA 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Cosmic Power", "Description": "Boosts Def and SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Counter", "Description": "If hit by a physical attack, returns double the damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Cut", "Description": "No additional effect."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dark Pulse", "Description": "20% chance to flinch."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Detect", "Description": "Prevents anything from working on the user that turn."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Double Team", "Description": "Boosts evasion 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Double-Edge", "Description": "Has 1/3 recoil."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Drain Punch", "Description": "Leeches 50% damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dream Eater", "Description": "Leeches 50% of the damage dealt.

Substitute is also mandatory, as it protects Mr. Mime and its teammates from status effects, Dragon Tail, critical hits, and Leech Seed, which would all cause major issues otherwise. Calm Mind is Mr. Mime's most reliable way of boosting its stats. After a few Calm Mind Boosts, most special attackers will be unable to touch it. Encore is useful because it can give Mr. Mime many free setup opportunities, especially if it encores the opponent into a move it is immune to, such as Roar, Perish Song, Bug Buzz, Hyper Voice, or a Dragon-type move."}, {"Content": "Leftovers is the preferred item because Mr. Mime needs to stay as healthy as possible in order to make Substitutes without wearing itself down too quickly.

The rest of the EVs are thrown into HP and Special Defense because all common Perish Song users in OU are special attackers.

The only common users of Perish Song in OU are Politoed and Celebi. Mr. Mime is only immune to the move itself, not the actual Perish counter that activates after the move is used. Because of this, Baton Passing to Mr. Mime after Perish Song has been used does not stop Perish Song from working. If your opponent has a potential Perish Song user on their team, keeping Mr. Mime healthy is crucial because it must be counted on to switch in on a moment's notice. Because Espeon is so critical to the success of Baton Pass teams, knowing when to Baton Pass to it is crucial. Just one Whirlwind or Taunt is nearly always fatal. Whenever there is a slight chance of such a move being used, you need to Baton Pass to Espeon. Prankster Taunt users are especially tricky, since you need to pass to Espeon the turn before they switch in, which can be very difficult to predict. Mr. Mime is far from useless outside of its immunities. Its excellent Special Defense stat and access to Encore both allow it to have many opportunities to set up with Calm Mind. Make sure to have a few Defense and Speed boosts up before Baton Passing to Mr. Mime, as its awful physical bulk is very easy to take advantage of. It is also very important to keep a Substitute up whenever possible in order to prevent critical hits or status moves from ruining your chain."}, {"Content": "Espeon is a non-negotiable member of any full Baton Pass team. Its Magic Bounce ability is the only way Baton Pass teams have around Taunt and Whirlwind outside of the one-time-use Mental Herb item and the rather unreliable Ingrain Smeargle, respectively. It also helps in protecting the team from status-inducing moves and other miscellaneous moves, such as Encore. Scolipede is another important teammate. Its ability, Speed Boost, makes it by far the most reliable method of passing Speed boosts. It is essential for Baton Pass teams to outspeed the opponent in order to make sure the right Pokemon is always out on the field. Scolipede can also pass Substitutes, Iron Defense boosts, and Swords Dance boosts. Vaporeon is another Baton Pass staple with its boosting move of choice, Acid Armor. It possesses great defensive stats and a useful ability in Water Absorb. Mawile is a good teammate because of its excellent typing, great boosting moves in Iron Defense and Swords Dance, and useful Intimidate ability. Mega Scizor is very similar to Mawile in that it is a Steel-type with Iron Defense and Swords Dance. Its main draws over Mawile are its access to reliable recovery in Roost, and most importantly, its Technician Bullet Punch, which makes it one of the only ways Baton Pass teams have of beating Unaware Clefable. Celebi has access to Calm Mind, while Zapdos has a useful typing and access to Charge. Mew can use nearly every stat boosting move in the game, most notably Amnesia, Barrier, and Calm Mind. Smeargle is the only Pokemon in the game with both Ingrain and Baton Pass. As such, it is a useful Pokemon on Baton Pass teams because it can protect the entire team from being phased out while regaining a small amount of HP every turn.

Another big reason that it is required to keep Stealth Rock away from Ho-Oh is that this set doesn't have a recovery move and must rely on Regenerator to gain health back.

There are a few roads you can go here, the first being spamming Sacred Fire with Ho-Oh to spread burns. After the opponent's switch-ins are burnt, Ho-Oh can pressure them harder with its coverage moves.

Thunder Wave is an excellent way to support Ho-Oh, but the move leaves it with a bit of four-moveslot syndrome, as it cannot use both Substitute and Thunder Wave without giving up on either coverage or recovery. However, if foregoing Substitute, Ho-Oh can paralyze fast switch-ins such as Kyogre and Arceus, making it far from useless.

This is because Giratina-O, which has no recovery, is likely to be outlasted by the opposing Stealth Rock user.

It also 2HKOes any Kyogre variant thanks to the boost from Life Orb. The recoil from Life Orb and Brave Bird can be quite upsetting at times, but don't forget that in conjunction with Regenerator and the recovery move of your choice, the lost HP can be gained back quite easily. Its secondary STAB move, Sacred Fire, is extremely potent. Even if a Pokemon that resists it switches in on this move, Ho-Oh still has a 50% chance of leaving it with a burn, assuming it hits. Few switch-ins enjoy the residual damage from burns, with Arceus formes such as Water and Rock being prime examples. The burn rate discourages just about all physical attackers from switching into Ho-Oh, as a burn will render them useless for the rest of the game. Zekrom, which resists both of Ho-Oh's STAB moves, is a good example. Under harsh sunlight, Sacred Fire is boosted by 50%, making it Ho-Oh's strongest attack, and has a good chance of 2HKOing even the most defensive variants of Groudon. It cannot be understated that Sacred Fire's power in combination with its side effect is what makes Ho-Oh such a difficult Pokemon to switch into."}, {"Content": "A recovery move is mandatory. When a Pokemon has Regenerator, a base 154 Special Defense, a base 130 Attack, and two nearly unresisted STAB moves, that's already pushing it. Giving it Roost is almost taking the term bulky attacker too far, as with it, Ho-Oh's longevity easily outmatches just about everything else in the game as long as Stealth Rock is off the field. The choice between Roost and Recover is a preference issue. Roost helps Ho-Oh against some would-be super effective hits, especially with paralysis support, while Recover is nice against Earthquake users that try to predict when it will land. However, with Recover, Pokemon such as a burned Groudon can easily get back to smashing Ho-Oh with Stone Edge after you reveal the move."}, {"Content": "Substitute eases prediction, and it's rather easy for Ho-Oh to recover the lost health. In conjunction with a Toxic lure for Ho-Oh's biggest counter, Rock Arceus, this move puts a lot of pressure on said counter by forcing it to rack up Toxic damage. As Ho-Oh's attacks are very powerful, a free Substitute means that your opponent will almost always have to sacrifice a Pokemon just to break it. One of the biggest assets of Substitute is that Ho-Oh can take advantage of the free turns that can come with potential paralysis support. Against paralyzed threats such as Xerneas and Palkia (in sun), Ho-Oh can spam Substitute and Roost until they are fully paralyzed, giving it a free Substitute. If Substitute isn't your thing, Earthquake is very viable as it 2HKOes Tyranitar, Zekrom, and Rock Arceus, while OHKOing Heatran. However, giving up on Substitute means Ho-Oh will have a tougher time protecting itself from revenge killers and status."}, {"Content": "Ho-Oh has two options that can go in the last moveslot to attempt to patch up its mediocre Speed. The first one, Flame Charge, deals damage and provides a boost to Ho-Oh's Speed that remains until it switches out. The other option, Tailwind, doubles Ho-Oh's Speed as well as those of its teammates. However, Tailwind only lasts for three turns, so the boost is inconsistent. The opportunity cost of losing Substitute or Earthquake is large, but if your team needs the specific advantages that either of these two moves bring, then by all means, use them. Also, remember to invest in Speed accordingly - Flame Charge sets generally need max Speed investment in order to outspeed Mega Mewtwo Y after one boost, while Tailwind sets like having 176 Speed EVs to outspeed Choice Scarf Terrakion while Tailwind is in play."}, {"Content": "This set appreciates the high damage output that comes with Life Orb, but Leftovers is usable to increase Ho-Oh's tanking ability and mitigate recoil damage. However, the power loss is quite large, as for example, defensive Kyogre can only be 3HKOed while defensive Giratina is only 4HKOed."}, {"Content": "An Adamant nature with maximum Attack investment is rather self-explanatory for a bulky attacker like Ho-Oh, and it is usually the best option to maximize its damage output. However, settling for a specialized number catered to a specific team's needs is of course viable as well. 252 HP EVs gives Ho-Oh great bulk, allowing it to cushion most neutral special attacks comfortably."}, {"Content": "For optimal performance, Ho-Oh will need Stealth Rock off its own side of this field in order to reliably switch in and take maximum advantage of Regenerator. It is therefore important to play your Defog user or Rapid Spinner in such a way so that it outlasts the opponents Stealth Rock setter. Keep in mind that Arceus formes, the most common Defog users, are vulnerable to Toxic, so keep them away from Stealth Rock users that carry the move. When you have the chance to get Ho-Oh in, take it. Dishing out hits and regenerating Ho-Oh's health puts a lot of pressure on opponents, especially if they don't carry a dedicated check to it."}, {"Content": "As Ho-Oh has a very exploitable weakness, it is important to properly scout for surprise Rock-type moves. Mixed Xerneas can use Rock Slide, Giratina-O can carry Stone Edge, and Aegislash can have Head Smash in its arsenal. Even some Arceus formes carry Stone Edge just to ruin Ho-Oh's day. Understanding how metagame defining Ho-Oh is and accepting that players can prepare and use moves just for it should always be accounted for. As Ho-Oh is brutally weak to Stealth Rock, the entry hazard must be kept off the field, therefore requiring a teammate's support."}, {"Content": "Do not make the mistake of using this set as your only way to stop a boosted Xerneas. It's hard to rely on Defog at all times, and Ho-Oh cannot OHKO Xerneas. In general, use Ho-Oh as the powerful wallbreaker it is, but don't rely on it as a check to too many Pokemon. Try to build your team in a way that you can use Ho-Oh's qualities to their maximum potential, but make sure that it isn't overly reliant on Ho-Oh's performance."}, {"Content": "Defog support is on the brink of mandatory when using Ho-Oh. Rapid Spin works too, but the spinners themselves are underpowered by Ubers standards. However, spinning can work with some smart teambuilding. The most reliable Defog users are Arceus formes due to their high Speed, good bulk, and access to Recover. Water Arceus has pretty good synergy with Ho-Oh, taking on Kyogre, Groudon, and Rock Arceus quite well. Grass Arceus floats in the same boat, but is weaker to the omnipresent Gengar and has a hard time fitting Stone Edge on its Defog set, meaning that it gives opposing Ho-Oh a lot of free turns. Since Grass Arceus is generally very weak to Ho-Oh, this can limit your teambuilding options a lot. Fairy Arceus is another notable Defog user, as just like most Arceus formes, it can cripple the Stealth Rock users that also happen to check Ho-Oh, such as Landorus-T and Groudon. Some less common Defog users are viable as well. Lugia can act as an extra wall and check a lot of Pokemon, while Scizor helps out tremendously when it comes to making your team solid against Geomancy Xerneas."}, {"Content": "Groudon is another terrific teammate, as it takes on Zekrom pretty well and can set up Stealth Rock, which Ho-Oh appreciates. Entry hazards heap up the pressure on opposing Pokemon that try to switch into Ho-Oh. Groudon's ability, Drought, provides sun support, and despite only lasting five turns, it is sufficient, considering that Ho-Oh has an easy time coming in against some Pokemon that threaten Groudon in the sun, such as Palkia, Grass Arceus, and Kyurem-White. Landorus-T is a good partner as well. While Groudon can phaze, use Thunder Wave, and strike with Fire-type moves, Landorus-T better checks Mega Blaziken."}, {"Content": "Palkia deserves a mention as a good teammate as well. It has great synergy with Ho-Oh, as it checks all Kyogre variants, and the combined force of the two threats pressures defensive teams. Lastly, Ho-Oh fits quite well together with Kyogre; Ho-Oh can help by checking Grass Arceus while Kyogre can pressure Rock Arceus."}, {"Content": "Any Pokemon with Thunder Wave is a good partner for Ho-Oh, as it can possibly get free Substitutes or outspeed Pokemon it normally doesn't. Groudon, Lugia, Kyogre, Klefki, Thundurus, and Dialga are some examples of common Thunder Wave users, but a lot of other Ubers such as Palkia can learn the move too, so cater the support to your team's needs."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Life Orb"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 248, "Attack": 252, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 8}, "Natures": [0], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brave Bird", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Sacred Fire", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Recover", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Roost", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earthquake", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Substitute", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Tank"}], "Name": "Ho-Oh", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 0, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Pressure"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Regenerator"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 110, "HP": 106, "Attack": 130, "Defense": 90, "SpecialDefense": 154, "Speed": 90}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aerial Ace", "Description": "Ignores accuracy modifiers."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Air Cutter", "Description": "High critical hit rate."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Ancient Power", "Description": "10% chance to boost all stats 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brave Bird", "Description": "Has 1/3 recoil damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulldoze", "Description": "Lowers target's Speed by 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Calm Mind", "Description": "Boosts SpA and SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Charge Beam", "Description": "70% chance to boost SpA 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Defog", "Description": "Lowers target's evasion 1 stage.

Brave Bird is also good for hitting Pokemon Crobat would commonly switch into, namely Grass- and Fighting-types. Roost heals Crobat back up and allows it to keep going, which is absolutely vital given its Stealth Rock weakness. Defog is a must-have, as it allows Crobat to take on a more utility-based role for the team by removing hazards from both sides. Taunt is preferred for the 4th moveslot as it allows this set to hinder defensive teams by preventing status moves and setup, working well with Defog as it helps Crobat stop hazard users such as Ferrothorn with ease. Toxic can be used to whittle down walls and defensive Pokemon, as well as hitting Pokemon behind Substitutes. U-turn can be used in the last moveslot if gaining momentum is absolutely important. This allows Crobat to function as part of a potential VoltTurn core with its teammates and help them maintain the advantage against Pokemon whom Crobat can force out. Lastly, Super Fang can also be used, because with Taunt and Brave Bird, it becomes much more of a pain to switch into Crobat, even for Steel-types."}, {"Content": "Black Sludge is useful for giving Crobat passive recovery. The given EVs and nature maximize bulk while allowing Crobat to outpace Noivern, the fastest threat whom Crobat can afford to deal with and get a fast Brave Bird off on while still allowing Crobat to OHKO Trevenant and Alakazam and 2HKO Greninja, specially defensive Tentacruel, offensive Starmie, Conkeldurr, Mega Venusaur, and Lucario with Brave Bird. Infiltrator is a must-have ability since it allows Crobat to beat Substitute users, and Inner Focus is generally inferior and more situational in comparison. Bear in mind, though, that Crobat's EVs aren't set entirely in stone, and can be customized specifically for the needs of the team. For instance, a spread of 252 HP / 58 SpD / 200 Spe may be more optimal for maximizing bulk for a full utility-based role, though the loss of power in Brave Bird will be significant. An offensive EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can also be used to maximize Crobat's strength and speed, allowing it to outpace even base 70 Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf, though Crobat will lose out on a lot of bulk, and the extra Speed does not help it outrun many other relevant threats."}, {"Content": "This set can be seen as a \"glue\" for teams that have issues with both heavily defensive teams and frail offensive hitters, as it does a decent job of handling both; as such, the moves can be easily adjusted if there are certain threats your team needs to deal with more effectively. For instance, if you are already running a Rapid Spin user, Toxic can be used over Defog, and with Roost and Taunt, Crobat can shut down any wall that isn't immune to Toxic and keep it from healing itself. It's preferred to take out the opponent's Stealth Rock user before using Defog, otherwise you risk compromising Crobat's bulk to repeated switch-ins to Stealth Rock. Try not to use the move beforehand unless it is absolutely necessary. Despite Crobat's incredible Speed, it is highly prone to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users. If you run U-turn, hard switching is often advised rather than attempting to stomach a blow from an offensive Pokemon and U-turn, even if you're anticipating a resisted hit. When playing defensively, Crobat needs all the HP it can hang on to given its Stealth Rock weakness and opposing offensive pressure that can keep it from using Roost. Don't hesitate to go for Taunt against most defensive Pokemon, even if they are capable of dealing a hard blow; between Taunt and Roost, you'll be able to shrug off damage and maintain the advantage against most walls. Crobat also functions as a solid counter to Gliscor, due to being immune to both Earthquake and Toxic, while stopping it from doing anything with Taunt. Be wary of sets carrying Ice Fang, though, as they can eventually wear down Crobat and force it to Roost, possibly taking it out with an Earthquake, while taking little in return from Brave Bird thanks to Poison Heal."}, {"Content": "Though Crobat's typing offers it numerous weaknesses, it has resistances that allow it to fit into teams and cover up holes very easily. A teammate who can deal with Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon is absolutely mandatory, as they are hard stops to Crobat. Magnezone is a solid partner in this regard since Magnet Pull lets it reliably trap and kill a number of Steel-type Pokemon, while beating Rock-type Pokemon with STAB Flash Cannon on top of resisting all four of Crobat's weaknesses by itself. Despite having a shared Psychic weakness, Conkeldurr works well with Crobat as it not only lures out Mega Venusaur, who can be beaten by Crobat, but it deals with Zapdos, Heatran, Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Bisharp with ease. Conkeldurr's access to Guts also means it can utilize status spread by Heatran, Zapdos, or Rotom-W and hit even harder. As mentioned, Crobat is a solid Gliscor check, so physical attackers who have trouble breaking through it, such as Swords Dance Aegislash, Garchomp, Mega Mawile, and Bisharp, are all partners who can take advantage of Crobat's support. Crobat is also able to plow down most Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Breloom, Trevenant, Venusaur, Celebi, Conkeldurr, and Lucario with Brave Bird so Pokemon who appreciate their removal, such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, Quagsire, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon, work with Crobat effectively. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock who can take advantage of its Defog support also work well, such as Volcarona, Dragonite, Charizard, and Thundurus, since they all have an easier time sweeping with hazards missing from their side of the field."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Black Sludge"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 168, "Attack": 136, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 4, "Speed": 200}, "Natures": [11], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brave Bird", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Roost", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Defog", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Taunt", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Toxic", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Standard"}], "Name": "Crobat", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 3, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Infiltrator"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Inner Focus"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 70, "HP": 85, "Attack": 90, "Defense": 80, "SpecialDefense": 80, "Speed": 130}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Acrobatics", "Description": "Doubles in power if user has no held item."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aerial Ace", "Description": "Ignores accuracy modifiers."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Air Cutter", "Description": "High critical hit rate."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Air Slash", "Description": "High critical hit rate."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Astonish", "Description": "30% chance to flinch."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Attract", "Description": "Targets of the opposite gender are infatuated and have a 50% chance to do nothing."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bite", "Description": "10% chance to flinch."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brave Bird", "Description": "Has 1/3 recoil damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Captivate", "Description": "Lowers an opposite gender foe's SpA 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confuse Ray", "Description": "Confuses the target."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Cross Poison", "Description": "Has a high critical hit rate. 10% chance to poison foe."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Curse", "Description": "Does 1/4 damage per turn at the cost of half the user's max HP if the user is a Ghost.

Calm Mind is used to boost Suicune's Special Attack and Special Defense simultaneously with the ultimate aim of a sweep. Scald is Suicune's only attacking move, and is chosen over other options such as Surf solely due to its burn chance. This makes up for Suicune's unboosted physical bulk and prevents Pokemon such as Dragonite and Gyarados from boosting in its face. Also notable is the fact that a Scald burn can also help wear down special walls more quickly. Because Suicune will be taking a plethora of hits while setting up, Rest is mandatory to heal off both damage and status. Sleep Talk is used alongside it so that Suicune can continue boosting and attacking while asleep."}, {"Content": "In terms of items, Leftovers is the clear option for Suicune.

A Bold nature is used for the same reason."}, {"Content": "This CroCune set is best brought out in the endgame.

Specifically, Pokemon that can wall Suicune's mono-attacking coverage or power or that are otherwise unthreatened by its power, such as Jellicent, Blissey, and Quagsire, all fall to Toxic Spikes. Pokemon that can form a Fire / Water / Grass core with Suicune have excellent defensive synergy with it and are thus excellent partners. Examples of this include Celebi, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. For a more offensive approach, Pursuit users such as Tyranitar, Scizor, and Weavile can eliminate Jellicent and Celebi, two of Suicune's best counters. Scizor, along with Genesect, is also notable for being able to scare out or OHKO Celebi with its powerful U-turn. Alternatively, one can run Suicune alongside wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon, which can wear down Suicune's checks and set up a late-game Suicune sweep."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "",

Also, a predicted switch allows you to use Substitute and then Protect on the next turn. This allows you to gain a speed boost after and the ability to pass on a Substitute to an another Pokemon on your team. Roar is used mainly to prevent Blaziken from being phazed out.

It takes capitalizes on Blaziken's offensive stats and allow it to become the wallbreaker it is known as. The slashes represent three possible sets that you can run: Protect + 3 attacks, Swords Dance and three attacks and Swords Dance and Protect with 2 attacks. An Adamant nature is used so that your moves can deal more damage which allows you to OHKO Pokemon such as Kyogre not normally OHKO'd by Jolly. Jolly can be used over Adamant in order to boost Blaziken's speed and allow it to out speed scarfers such as Zekrom after one boost in its mega evolution or after two in its life orb set. However, it loses offensive prowess that it would normally enjoy. Life Orb Blaziken allows you to use another Pokemon that can mega evolve and benefit your team."}, {"Content": "Be wary about flat out switching Blaziken in as it has relatively low bulk which means that it easily takes heavy damage from everything and can possibly get OHKO'd if your not careful. Because of this, watch out for priority moves that can revenge kill you such as extreme speed on Arceus and Rayquaza. Using Protect allows you to gain +1 from speed boost to build momentum. It also offers added utility in allowing you to see what move your opponent was going for and allows you to utilize that information to your advantage. Don't just spam Flare Blitz blindly as the recoil racks up quickly and can leave Blaziken fairly vulnerable to revenge killers. If you opt for Knock off, it allows Blaziken to catch Pokemon on the switch and cripple them. It even allows more damage against Giratina which usually is able to take hits from Blaziken since it resists fire and is immune to fighting."}, {"Content": "Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rocks are really useful for Blaziken as it enjoys the extra damage from it done to Lugia, Ho-h, and Yveltal. This includes Pokemon such as Groudon and Landorus-T. Groudon can be used to help Mega Blaziken by setting up the sun and dispelling the rain which even allows Flare Blitz to do more damage. It also checks Ekiller Arceus as it can take hits and retaliate with an attack or thunder wave which cripples Arceus. You can run lava plume on Groudon in order to catch opposing Landorus-T off guard and score a burn. This leaves Landorus-T crippled for the rest of the match. Landorus-T as a team mate provides intimidate support and checks Ho-oh which counters Blaziken. It also carriest U-turn which allows Blaziken to get a free switch. Yveltal can wall break many of the Pokemon that can wall Blaziken such as Giratina forms. Xerneas can be used as another offensive sweeper and able to deal with both Giratina forms. Wobbuffet is an interesting team member as it is able to trap and take out any Pokemon that can check or counter Blaziken. It can be used with Xerneas with Hidden Power fire to create a powerful core.Palkia is a great team member as it can sponge water moves thrown at Blaziken and deal with Rayquaza that can revenge kill Blaziken. U-turn/Volt Switch users such as Genesect and Zekrom that can get Blaziken a free switch. E-killer Arceus can be a good team member as well. Blaziken is able to weaken the opponent's team by KOing or debilitating Arceus's checks. This allows Arceus to come in and sweep."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Blazikenite"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Life Orb"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 4, "Attack": 252, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [11, 0], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Low Kick", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Flare Blitz", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Protect", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Swords Dance", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Knock Off", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Protect", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Offensive"}], "Name": "Blaziken", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 0, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Blaze"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Speed Boost"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 110, "HP": 80, "Attack": 120, "Defense": 70, "SpecialDefense": 70, "Speed": 80}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Acrobatics", "Description": "Doubles in power if user has no held item."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aerial Ace", "Description": "Ignores accuracy modifiers."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Agility", "Description": "Boosts Spe 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Attract", "Description": "Targets of the opposite gender are infatuated and have a 50% chance to do nothing."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Baton Pass", "Description": "User switches, but passes on all stat changes and some special conditions."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Blast Burn", "Description": "User cannot move next turn."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Blaze Kick", "Description": "High critical hit rate. 10% chance to burn the target."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Body Slam", "Description": "30% chance to paralyze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bounce", "Description": "User is made invulnerable for one turn, then hits the next turn. 30% chance to paralyze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brave Bird", "Description": "Has 1/3 recoil damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brick Break", "Description": "Destroys Light Screen and Reflect, then hits."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulk Up", "Description": "Boosts Atk and Def 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulldoze", "Description": "Lowers target's Speed by 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Captivate", "Description": "Lowers an opposite gender foe's SpA 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Counter", "Description": "If hit by a physical attack, returns double the damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Crush Claw", "Description": "50% chance to lower Def 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Curse", "Description": "Does 1/4 damage per turn at the cost of half the user's max HP if the user is a Ghost.

Make sure to alternate between Protect and Substitute only when Gliscor is Toxic stalling a faster Pokemon. Earthquake should only be used when finishing off weakened slower targets or when up against a Steel-type. It is best to not start Toxic stalling until bulky Pokemon immune to Toxic are taken out. Watch out for Air Balloon users such as Heatran or Aegislash, as they shut down this set completely. If Gliscor is against a status user before Toxic Orb has activated, use Protect to block the opponent's attack. After Toxic Orb activates, Gliscor also makes a great Knock Off absorber.

Scald allows Blastoise to punish physical attackers that try to switch into it with a potential burn. With a boost from Mega Launcher, Water Pulse is a 90 Base Power move with a nifty 20% chance of confusing the opponent. Hydro Pump is another option as it hits harder than both Scald and Water Pulse, but is less reliable due to its lower accuracy. Dark Pulse is mandatory, as it removes unwanted Ghost-types, such as Jellicent and Trevenant, that block Rapid Spin. The last moveslot is dedicated to specific threats and should be chosen based on your team's specific troubles. Aura Sphere, which is boosted by Mega Launcher, hits Tyranitar and Ferrothorn harder than any other move. Another option is Ice Beam, which hits Dragon-types such as Dragonite while still being able to hit Grass-types, such as Tangrowth and Breloom, hard."}, {"Content": "The given EV spread is standard for a tank, allowing Blastoise to take a few hits while still hitting hard. For normal Blastoise, Rain Dish is the preferred ability, as Blastoise should Mega Evolve as soon as possible, making the boost from Torrent largely useless. Rain Dish also provides Blastoise with some recovery under the odd Drizzle. An alternative EV spread is 188 HP / 252 SpA / 68 Spe, which allows Blastoise to outspeed defensive Rotom-W. This EV spread does detract from Blastoise's good bulk, however."}, {"Content": "Blastoise should be used on offensive teams that need a sturdy tank. Teams with Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards and rely on entry hazards themselves really appreciate Blastoise as a spinner. Blastoise should Mega Evolve as soon as possible to take advantage of the power of Mega Launcher. It shouldn't be played recklessly however, as it lacks recovery and can easily be worn down with entry hazards and repeated hits."}, {"Content": "Teammates that can handle annoying Electric- and Grass-types are appreciated. Dragon-types such as Latios have nice synergy with Blastoise, as they resist both Electric- and Grass-type moves. In return, Blastoise can tank Ice Beams and remove Stealth Rock for them. Grass-types such as Venusaur can easily take multiple hits from the annoying Rotom-W, other Electric-types, and Grass-types. Tornadus-T is a valuable partner as it can beat Mega Venusaur. It can also beat Toxicroak with a Flying-type move, while Blastoise can remove Stealth Rock for Tornadus-T in return. Another excellent partner is Talonflame.

Razor Shell is Barbaracle's primary STAB move, being far more accurate than Stone Edge and just on par in terms of power thanks to Tough Claws. Stone Edge is Barbaracle's secondary STAB move that cuts any Pokemon weak to it to ribbons, and is the strongest attack against Pokemon that resist Water-type moves and take neutral damage from Rock-type moves, such as Rotom-W. Both of Barbaracle's STAB moves are compulsory, as not only are they its strongest attacks, but they grant important super effective coverage, hitting some key physically defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mandibuzz. Earthquake is Barbaracle's best bet for muscling past Aegislash, as at +2 it cleanly OHKOes min Defense variants and has a good chance to defeat max HP variants after Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake offers 100% accuracy and good coverage in general, hitting Pokemon such as Jirachi very hard. Cross Chop allows Barbaracle to OHKO or deal massive damage to Pokemon such as Chansey. It also smashes Ferrothorn, which can otherwise comfortably take a hit from Barbaracle and OHKO or cripple it in return. Cross Chop 2HKOes Gastrodon, while the retaliatory Earth Power fails to OHKO back. A White Herb must be used to accomplish this, as Gastrodon's Earth Power will OHKO a Barbaracle with -1 Special Defense."}, {"Content": "The EVs for Barbaracle's Shell Smash set are simple and optimal. 232 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow +2 Barbaracle to outpace Deoxys-S as well as Choice Scarf users with base 102 Speed and under. An Adamant nature is acceptable to increase damage output; however, with it a boosted Barbaracle will fail to outspeed Choice Scarf Kyurem-B and anything faster. Full Attack investment maximizes Barbaracle's power, and it needs every ounce of strength it can get. Due to its lack of priority and the Defense drop from Shell Smash, Barbaracle usually cannot afford to run a Life Orb if it plans to sweep. Thus, more conservative options that can improve its survivability are favored. White Herb is an invaluable item to Barbaracle, allowing it to retain its solid physical bulk making it more resistant to priority. White Herb also restores the stat drop from Sticky Web, allowing Barbaracle to sweep after setting up against fast Choice Scarf users. Mystic Water is a considerable option as Razor Shell is the most frequently used move, and the power increase helps against a number of checks such as Garchomp. Lum Berry allows Barbaracle to set up in the face of status users; this is important, as the more setup opportunities it has, the better. Lum Berry also protects Barbaracle against Prankster status users such as Thundurus, Mega Banette, Sableye, and Klefki, all of which would otherwise stop a sweep. Finally, Life Orb may be considered on Barbaracle. The power boost is immense, letting Barbaracle act as a bit more of a wallbreaker than a sweeper, as the recoil is often too much for it to sweep in the face of priority moves or damage sustained damage while setting up."}, {"Content": "What must be understood about Barbaracle is that although it is fast and strong after one turn of set up, it can not cleanly OHKO everything. In some cases, bulky Pokemon with resistances to Barbaracle's best moves, such as Celebi, Garchomp, and Keldeo, can easily avoid an OHKO at full strength and retaliate with an OHKO. Because of this, it's best to leave Barbaracle for later in the game when these Pokemon have been weakened. Barbaracle is fantastic at tanking Extreme Speed and priority Brave Bird, as well as brushing off neutral priority moves. However, Fighting-type priority moves and the strongest neutral ones such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Bisharp's Sucker Punch can do sizable amounts of damage to it. Thus, it is ill-advised to attempt to sweep without accounting for these moves, either by attempting to preserve's Barbaracle's HP during set up or trapping and eliminating these priority users. As for setup opportunities, taking advantage of resisted Choice-locked moves, especially Fire-type moves is ideal. A small number of Pokemon can be forced out by Barbaracle, creating turns to set up. Heatran and Tyranitar are probably the most common as they will often be slower and at risk of being knocked out by Barbaracle. In general, identify the bulky Pokemon that need to be worn down and the priority and Choice Scarf users that check Barbaracle offensively, and work so that they are sufficiently weakened before setting up."}, {"Content": "Like any sweeper, Barbaracle loves entry hazard support. Flying-types that are typically immune to Spikes are easily handled by Barbaracle's STAB combination, letting Barbaracle dominate both flying and grounded opponents when the entry hazard is set up. Dual screens, Memento, and suicide leads with Taunt can give Barbaracle many more chances to set up, turning the tide of the game very quickly. Deoxys-S excels at all of these roles and makes a good partner for Barbaracle. Latios is capable of a dual screens + Memento set which ensures set up even against very strong opponents. Because of Barbaracle's slow Speed and relative frailness, it has a hard time setting up, so this kind of support is strongly recommended. Pokemon that are able to defeat the hardest stops to Barbaracle are ideal partners. Strong wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham and Kyurem-B soften up the opponent's defenses easily getting past bulky Grass-types and physical walls thanks to their amazing power and coverage. With the right moves, trappers such as Gothitelle can work to beat many defensive checks to Barbaracle, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Venusaur, and Rotom-W. Barbaracle's HP and Special Defense are overall mediocre, so removing entry hazards from your side of the field conserves precious HP that it needs to set and up and sweep successfully. Partners that can remove these entry hazards such Excadrill, Scizor, Latios, and Starmie are appreciated."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Mystic Water"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "White Herb"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 24, "Attack": 252, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 232}, "Natures": [11, 0], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Shell Smash", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Razor Shell", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Stone Edge", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Cross Chop", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earthquake", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Shell Smash Sweeper"}], "Name": "Barbaracle", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 8, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Pickpocket"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Sniper"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Tough Claws"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 54, "HP": 72, "Attack": 105, "Defense": 115, "SpecialDefense": 86, "Speed": 68}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aerial Ace", "Description": "Ignores accuracy modifiers."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Ancient Power", "Description": "10% chance to boost all stats 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Attract", "Description": "Targets of the opposite gender are infatuated and have a 50% chance to do nothing."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Blizzard", "Description": "10% chance to freeze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brick Break", "Description": "Destroys Light Screen and Reflect, then hits."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulk Up", "Description": "Boosts Atk and Def 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulldoze", "Description": "Lowers target's Speed by 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Clamp", "Description": "Prevents the opponent from attacking for 2-5 turns."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Cross Chop", "Description": "High critical hit rate."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Cut", "Description": "No additional effect."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dig", "Description": "User is made invulnerable for one turn, then hits the next turn."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Double Team", "Description": "Boosts evasion 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dragon Claw", "Description": "No additional effect."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earthquake", "Description": "Hits Pokemon using Dig with double Base Power."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Embargo", "Description": "Item use is prevented for five turns."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Facade", "Description": "Has 140 Base Power when burned, paralyzed, or poisoned."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "False Swipe", "Description": "Always leaves the foe with at least 1 HP."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Fling", "Description": "Throws the user's hold item at the foe.

Return is Mega Kangaskhan's most consistent and drawback-free STAB; however, Double-Edge can be used to snag a few useful KOs. For example, with the combination of Fake Out + Double-Edge and an Adamant nature, Mega Kangaskhan has the chance to OHKO 252 / 92 Togekiss and even 0 / 0 Landorus-T through Intimidate. However, Mega Kangaskhan's power is so great that Fake Out and Return is enough to OHKO threats such as 252 / 0 Rotom-W. Sucker Punch is Mega Kangaskhan's main means of revenge killing the opponent, as the move can easily wipe out Latios and a weakened Reuniclus under Trick Room. Power-Up Punch is what allows Mega Kangaskhan to sweep and break past bulkier targets; it boosts her Attack stat to two stages, allowing her to, at worst, 2HKO the entire metagame. Once boosted, Power-Up Punch can also function as a decent coverage move against the likes of Heatran and Tyranitar."}, {"Content": "There are a few alternate moves that Mega Kangaskhan can make use of, such as Crunch, Drain Punch, and Protect. Crunch allows Mega Kangaskhan to bust through Ghost-types without having to lean on the unreliable Sucker Punch. Drain Punch works superbly in tandem with Double-Edge by giving Mega Kangaskhan a decent coverage move for the likes of Heatran and Tyranitar, while simultaneously restoring her health. Lastly, Protect can help keep Mega Kangaskhan from being exposed to her own teammates' spread moves or targeted by the two opposing Pokemon, while allowing her partner to deal with a troublesome check so that she won't constantly be forced to switch out and possibly lose her Attack boosts. If any of these moves sound appealing, they should be used over either Power-Up Punch or Fake Out, though forgoing the previous two options takes away much of the sweeping and utility potential that Mega Kangaskhan possesses."}, {"Content": "Scrappy is chosen as the main ability so that Kangaskhan can flinch a Ghost-type with Fake Out should a situation require it, such as to stop Trevenant or Jellicent from setting up Trick Room. When it comes to natures, an Adamant one is generally preferred, as it can achieve the above KOs. Furthermore, Kangaskhan has no shortage of priority moves, so the extra Speed bestowed by a Jolly nature is less necessary. However, it can be useful to get the jump on max Speed base 90s such as Landorus-T and Lucario, outspeed neutral natured base 100s such as Volcarona, have a better chance to oust opposing Fake Out Mega Kangaskhan, and Speed tie with max Speed 100s such as Charizard. As far as alternate EV spreads are concerned, Mega Kangaskhan can relinquish her Speed EVs and instead add them to HP in order to take better advantage of her naturally high bulk, which proves especially handy should Mega Kangaskhan have some form of speed control support."}, {"Content": "It's best to bring Mega Kangaskhan in mid-game, as at that point, the opposing team will be weakened enough for her to smash through with her impressive power, or help her pull off a sweep with greater ease. However, Mega Kangaskhan can also be brought in at the start of the match to provide handy Fake Out support and/or stop the opposing team's Fake Out user. She can also make use of this move by providing her teammates an opportunity to set up themselves. Fake Out can also be used in tandem with Sucker Punch to revenge kill speed demons such as Swift Swim Kingdra or be used alone to stop the likes of Trick Room Aromatisse from setting up. Although Fake Out is obviously the first move to use once Mega Kangaskhan is sent out, it's very much dependent on the given battle conditions whether or not she should straight-up attack or attempt a sweep with Power-Up Punch. It's also good to analyze the situation at hand--whether it's worth going for a sweep or switching Mega Kangaskhan back out to utilize Fake Out again. When against less threatening targets such as Jirachi, Zygarde, or weakened Pokemon such as Abomasnow or Kyurem-B, it's the perfect time to go for Power-Up Punch; however, against slower, bulkier, and more threatening targets such as Conkeldurr or Hitmontop, it's moreso in Mega Kangaskhan's favor to go straight for the kill."}, {"Content": "Do note that Mega Kangaskhan should not be brought in against status-wielding threats (provided that she doesn't have the right support) such as Jellicent or Klefki, as a quick burn or paralysis keeps Mega Kangaskhan from sweeping. Furthermore, it's also advised to take down the opposing team's Intimidate user, as it can continually switch in and out of Mega Kangaskhan and rob her of her Attack boosts. If the opposing team has more than one Intimidate user, then simply taking out one will suffice. Once all these unfriendly conditions are cleared, Mega Kangaskhan can use Power-Up Punch to easily sweep the opposing team and smash right through their bulky supporters."}, {"Content": "Volcarona makes a fantastic partner for Mega Kangaskhan, as it can roast the likes of Trevenant, Mega Mawile, and Aegislash with Heat Wave and/or redirect Fighting-type attacks and Will-O-Wisp with Rage Powder. In return, Mega Kangaskhan can provide Fake Out support, allowing Volcarona to launch an attack without fearing a potential Rock Slide user or set up a Quiver Dance with minimal difficulty. Similarly, Talonflame works well with Mega Kangaskhan, as it can destroy Fighting-types with Brave Bird and demolish Steel-types with Flare Blitz. Talonflame can also clean up after Mega Kangaskhan finishes pulverizing the opposing team. Mega Kangaskhan can aid Talonflame by dealing with the likes of Rotom-W and bulkier threats such as Cresselia. Another good Fire-type to pair Mega Kangaskhan with is Chandelure, given that it easily beats many of her checks with its Ghost / Fire typing, which gives it fantastic dual STABs."}, {"Content": "More support-oriented partners include Togekiss and Amoonguss. Togekiss and Amoonguss can both redirect crippling status moves and Fighting-type attacks with Follow Me and Rage Powder respectively. Moreover, Togekiss can make itself more useful by dealing with the likes of Trevenant and providing speed control support with either Thunder Wave or Tailwind. Amoonguss can also provide Spore support, which allows Mega Kangaskhan to take the time to use Power-Up Punch without having to worry about being crippled by a powerful attack. Furthermore, Amoonguss can also use Giga Drain to dent Terrakion and Jellicent. Cresselia and Klefki can also support Mega Kangaskhan in other ways. Both of these Pokemon can easily set up dual screens, which skyrockets Mega Kangaskhan's already impressive defenses. For instance, with Reflect activated, Mega Kangaskhan survives even a Life Orb-boosted Close Combat from Terrakion. This is useful as it allows her to make better use of Power-Up Punch, and in Cresselia's case, it can also provide Helping Hand support to give her attacks an even bigger kick. On the other hand, Klefki can make use of its priority Thunder Wave to easily cripple fast Fighting-types and other troublesome threats. Klefki can also utilize Prankster Swagger and Safeguard to give Mega Kangaskhan a free +2 Attack boost without the added confusion. Similarly, Latias can provide speed control support in the form of Thunder Wave or Tailwind, heal Mega Kangaskhan's HP by 50% with Heal Pulse, and boost her power with Helping Hand."}, {"Content": "Hitmontop and Scrafty excel at providing some unique offensive support. Both of these Pokemon sport Intimidate, which makes Mega Kangaskhan very difficult to take down and gives her more setup opportunities. Both of these Pokemon can also provide Fake Out support, which also helps Mega Kangaskhan to set up more easily. Unlike Hitmontop, Scrafty can deal with Ghost-types with its STAB Crunch; however, Hitmontop's neutrality to Fighting-type moves allows it to deal with Mega Lucario more easily. Speaking of Ghost-types, two other Pokemon that deal with them are Bisharp and Aegislash. Bisharp's STAB Knock Off can OHKO almost every Ghost-type. Bisharp can even help Mega Kangaskhan deal with faster threats with its own Sucker Punch and discourage repeated use of Intimidate thanks to Defiant. Aegislash can also take on Ghost-types, but it has the added benefit of being able to counter almost every Fighting-type as well. Aegislash also provides Wide Guard support to shield the two from Heat Waves and Earthquakes. Mega Kangaskhan can return the favor by using Fake Out to provide the chance for Substitute variants to set up."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Kangaskhanite"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 4, "Attack": 252, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [11, 0], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Fake Out", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Double-Edge", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Return", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Sucker Punch", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Power-Up Punch", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "All-Out Attacker"}, {"Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Scrappy"}], "Description": [{"Content": "Fake Out allows you to revenge kill weakened foes and gives you a turn to Mega Evolve and gain a new Speed tier."}, {"Content": "Return is the mandatory STAB nailing a large portion of the tier."}, {"Content": "Sucker Punch, in conjunction with Fake Out, gives Kangaskhan the ability to pick off weakened threats and serves as a kind of revenge killer."}, {"Content": "Earthquake hits Ferrothorn without taking Iron Barbs damage, while also hitting the many Steel-types in Ubers such as Dialga, Arceus-Steel, and Mega Scizor."}, {"Content": "Crunch nails Giratina on the switch, but does have redundant coverage alongside Sucker Punch, but it eases prediction against slower foes."}, {"Content": "EVs maximize power and Speed."}, {"Content": "Jolly allows you to outspeed base 90s like Kyogre, while also Speed tieing with other base 100s such as Palkia and other Mega Kangaskhan.

However, if that is not your cup of tea, Sludge Bomb can be used if you want the extra power. The last move is a bit of a toss-up. Stun Spore is the generally the best choice, as it paralyzes opponents and assists slower sweepers.

Foul Play allows Amoonguss to hit physical attackers hard on the switch-in and prevent it from being setup fodder for them, and moreover make it one of the best Aegislash checks in the game. Clear Smog is typically preferred in the last slot for the likes of Crocune, Calm Mind Clefable, and Calm Mind Manaphy, and to prevent Amoonguss from being setup fodder for any sweeper if another Pokemon on the opposing team has alredy been put to sleep. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb is Amoonguss's strongest reliable STAB move and has a useful 30% chance to poison, and boasts a decent damage output on the likes of Clefable, but the loss of Clear Smog actually causes it to lose to Calm Mind variants, which are very common, so it's typically not preferred. Hidden Power Fire is useful for hitting Ferrothorn, which is immune to Spore, and Mega Scizor, which it otherwise cannot significantly damage. Stun Spore is great alongside Spore, as it allows Amoonguss to spread status even further, but the loss of coverage is significant enough to prevent it from being preferred. Synthesis can be used for more reliable recovery, but it is a bit redundant with Regenerator, Giga Drain, and Black Sludge recovery, so it is generally inferior to Amoonguss's other moves."}, {"Content": "EVs are put into HP and Special Defense to allow Amoonguss to function as a solid Keldeo, Aegislash, and non-Hidden Power Flying or Psychic Thundurus counter.

The Defense EVs ensure it is never 2HKOed by Choice Band Azumarill's Play Rough after Stealth Rock damage. A spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 SpD with a Bold nature can also be used if Amoonguss is your sole check to Belly Drum Azumarill, allowing it to survive a +6 Play Rough 100% of the time, or even 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature to handle Azumarill reliably and even other physical threats. However, the loss of bulk against the aforementioned threats is heavily noticed. Black Sludge is the preferred item, as it provides great passive healing in conjunction with Regenerator. Leftovers can be used over Black Sludge, but Black Sludge is more useful as it cripples Trick users and deters them from using Trick on Amoonguss at all."}, {"Content": "As it is a pivot, Amoonguss will be switching in very often throughout the match.

Amoonguss will most often only be able to put one opponent to sleep in the entire match because a sleeping opponent often does not have a chance to wake up, so take note of which Pokemon you want to put to sleep before mindlessly clicking Spore. The mere threat of Spore is also very useful. Predicting which Pokemon the opponent will use as sleep fodder and capitalizing on it not only gains momentum, but it allows you to possibly put a more dangerous Pokemon on the opponent's team to sleep later in the battle. However, Amoonguss can be helpless against certain Pokemon after it has already put something else to sleep. Successfully using Spore to its greatest potential requires prediction and clever planning."}, {"Content": "To prevent Amoonguss from being setup bait after Spore has been used, you can utilize double switches to deter the opposing team from setting up on it."}, {"Content": "Amoonguss isn't too support reliant as it is usually the one doing the supporting.

It grants Amoonguss's partner significantly more maneuverability, can keep low-HP Pokemon on life support, and dramatically reduces the effectiveness of some of the opponent's Pokemon. Spore is excellent as it can put many major threats to sleep and allows Amoonguss to stop all common Trick Room setters outside of Trevenant and Overcoat Reuniclus. Giga Drain only deals acceptable damage when it's super effective, but is necessary for late-game situations and getting around Taunt. It can be tempting to run Sludge Bomb instead, as Amoonguss is ruined by Grass-types, but most Doubles Grass-types, such as Trevenant, Venusaur, and opposing Amoonguss, are only hit neutrally by Poison-type moves. Protect stalls for turns so Amoonguss's partner can switch and sidesteps Fake Out, which could otherwise stop Rage Powder."}, {"Content": "Mental Herb and Black Sludge are both passable items on Amoonguss. However, Taunt is not as common as it once was, as many Trick Room setters are now immune to it, so Mental Herb has also lost its usefulness somewhat. Black Sludge provides Amoonguss with reliable recovery, but Regenerator is usually sufficient in this regard. The best item tends to be Sitrus Berry, as it provides Amoonguss with a burst of vitality when it needs to use Rage Powder twice in a row, which is surprisingly often. Regenerator allows Amoonguss to replenish its health upon switching out and function as an effective pivot, and the given EV spread maximizes Amoonguss's special bulk, seeing as it usually redirects special attacks. The spread allows Amoonguss at full health to always survive a Timid Latios's Life Orb-boosted Psyshock, and Speed is minimized so it can work as well as possible against Trick Room, one of its main niches."}, {"Content": "One of Amoonguss's greatest perks is that it is almost always successful as a lead against heavy Trick Room: simply Spore the most threatening Pokemon that isn't immune to the move, be it setter or abuser. However, when it's not playing against Trick Room, Amoonguss should just focus on keeping its partner safe. Overall, using Amoonguss is fairly straightforward: use Spore to catch predicted switches or when your partner is Protecting, use Giga Drain on Water-types when your partner's not about to get Hydro Pumped, use Protect against Fake Out so that Rage Powder isn't blocked, and other than that, just spam Rage Powder. However, beware of becoming setup fodder for your opponent's Pokemon in the process--especially for Fire-types."}, {"Content": "Amoonguss is setup fodder for Fire-types, so it needs a teammate that can kill their momentum. Garchomp, Zygarde, and Tyranitar are all reliable switch-ins to Heatran, Chandelure, and Mega Charizard Y, and in return, Amoonguss can redirect the Will-O-Wisps that they attract. Amoonguss works especially well with Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Terrakion as well as with Heatran. Amoonguss can redirect the Close Combats, Hydro Pumps, and Focus Blasts that plague these Pokemon as well as threaten certain Ground-types; meanwhile, its partner deals with the Fire-types that Amoonguss is unable to defeat. However, all of these combos must be wary of Muddy Water and Earthquake. Amoonguss also partners well with Trick Room setters, redirecting attacks that would otherwise stop them, and then has a blazing fast Spore to help clean up. However, this often requires having two Pokemon on the field with no offensive presence, which is a disaster, and Amoonguss cannot redirect Spore, a common check to Trick Room. Another option is to pair Amoonguss with Pokemon that use setup moves, such as Belly Drum Azumarill, so that they cannot be crippled during their turn of setup.

Gyro Ball is a must for Ferrothorn as it 2HKOes Mega Gengar, a top threat in the metagame, preventing Ferrothorn from becoming fodder. Gyro Ball is a fairly reliable STAB move, and due to Ferrothorn's pathetic base 20 Speed, it usually strikes with its maximum Base Power of 150, 2HKOing Xerneas and smashing speedy threats such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Darkrai. Leech Seed chips away at an opposing Pokemon's HP and heals Ferrothorn in the process, allowing it to stall out threats and tank attacks for a longer period of time. As an added bonus, Leech Seed also allows Ferrothorn to check offensive variants of Kyogre. Though Leech Seed provides semi-reliable recovery, it cannot heal status conditions, does not affect Grass-types, and is cleared when the inflicted Pokemon switches out. Therefore, Rest is a viable alternative to Leech Seed, as it makes Ferrothorn more self-sufficient, fully restores its HP, and removes harmful status conditions such as burns, which severely inhibit Ferrothorn's defensive capabilities. In conjunction with Toxic, Rest also allows Ferrothorn to potentially stall out Defog users, as Lugia cannot damage it significantly, and most support Arceus formes can only use Will-O-Wisp and weak Judgments to hurt it. However, using Rest puts Ferrothorn to sleep, leaving it vulnerable for two turns, and cannot be used to damage opposing Pokemon."}, {"Content": "Toxic gives Ferrothorn the ability to cripple common switch-ins such as Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes, as well as place setup sweepers on a timer. Toxic damage compounds with Leech Seed damage and can be used to stall out opposing Pokemon. Toxic cripples Defog users so Ferrothorn can stay in on them and continuously replace the entry hazards lost to Defog. Power Whip can be used as a secondary STAB option, as it allows Ferrothorn to serve as a competent check to non-Choice Specs Kyogre. With its excellent bulk, Ferrothorn is able to repeatedly lay down entry hazards, which hinder the opposing team and punish switches with residual damage. Notably, it fairs better against Defog users than most other entry hazard setters, as it can cripple them with status moves. Spikes is the primary entry hazard as it has fairly limited distribution, as Stealth Rock can be run on a teammate. However, Spikes takes longer to set up and is therefore more vulnerable to Defog. Stealth Rock is a solid alternative, as it punishes a greater variety of threats than Spikes does, requires only one turn to set up, and is crucial in limiting the number of times Ho-Oh can switch in."}, {"Content": "Protect is an alternative option, as it allows Ferrothorn to scout for dangerous moves, benefit from passive recovery, and rack up Toxic and/or Leech Seed damage. The move can be exploited though, as it can give the opponent a free turn to switch to a Pokemon that threatens Ferrothorn, removing the effects of Leech Seed and resetting Toxic counters in the process. Knock Off can also provide additional utility, as it can remove the items of many targets. However, it can be difficult to fit Knock Off on Ferrothorn's moveset, and the move is mostly useless against Mega Evolutions and Arceus formes. Although having access to multiple support moves works in Ferrothorn's favor, the unfortunate truth is that it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it is unable to fit all the moves it wants on a single set."}, {"Content": "Iron Barbs is the chosen ability for the residual damage it provides on physical attackers that utilize contact moves. The ability also helps to punish weaker U-turns used by Pokemon such as Landorus-T. Leftovers is the optimal item choice for Ferrothorn, as the HP regeneration provided by Leftovers and Leech Seed is too good to pass up. A Sassy nature boosts Ferrothorn's special bulk and, along with running no Speed IVs, strengthens the power of Gyro Ball. The current EV spread maximizes Ferrothorn's special bulk, allowing it to check the multitude of special attackers in the tier as effectively as possible. Although investing in Special Defense is vastly superior, Ferrothorn has the option of investing in Defense, making it more efficient against physical attackers, such as Mega Kangaskhan. Furthermore, it can serve as a backup check to certain variants of Extreme Killer Arceus, as with defensive investment, it avoids the 2HKO from a boosted Lum Berry Adamant Extreme Killer Arceus's Earthquake. The four leftover EVs are placed into Attack to provide a slight buff to Ferrothorn's physical moves."}, {"Content": "Ferrothorn can function as a good check to a variety of top threats, tanking hits and slowly wearing them down with Leech Seed and Toxic. Ferrothorn cannot take hits from Kyogre with Choice Specs or multiple Calm Mind boosts, but is otherwise a solid check to the leviathan as it is only 3HKOed by Modest Kyogre's full-powered Water Spout. Ferrothorn can serve as a decent one-time check to unboosted Xerneas, as it can land a 2HKO with Gyro Ball. However, Ferrothorn should not switch in on a boosted Xerneas unless you are certain that it does not carry Focus Blast or Hidden Power Fire; both moves can KO Ferrothorn or damage it beyond repair. Ferrothorn can take advantage of Zekrom, setting up entry hazards against it or crippling a switch-in with Toxic. Furthermore, it can stall out Electric Arceus with Toxic fairly easily and check Palkia in rain. Ferrothorn generally beats walls that rely on Toxic to deal damage, such as Aegislash, Chansey, and Blissey, due to the immunity provided by its Steel typing, and it is able to set up entry hazards against them or pester them with Leech Seed. Ferrothorn does not have the ability to function as a pure wall, as it needs significant team support to make up for its flaws, but is a solid entry hazard setter and should be used as such."}, {"Content": "Be cautious when you have Ferrothorn out, as dangerous moves such as Fire Blast and Focus Blast have a very wide distribution. If you have Protect, use it to scout for these moves, but avoid being too obvious when you use Protect--telegraphing the use of the move is almost a surefire way for Ferrothorn to get set up on. Try to catch Pokemon with Leech Seed as they switch in in order to recover HP when you scout the opponent's moves with Protect. Furthermore, if a dangerous move is revealed, the HP drained by Leech Seed will benefit your chosen switch-in. Leech Seed works especially well against Chansey and Blissey due to their enormous HP stats; Ferrothorn also takes negligible net damage from Seismic Toss due to the passive recovery it receives every turn. Against faster threats, keep in mind that Gyro Ball has only eight PP, so Pressure users such as Mewtwo can quickly make it useless. If the opponent has Xerneas and you lack another solid answer to it, make sure you conserve Gyro Ball's PP."}, {"Content": "Kyogre is an outstanding partner for Ferrothorn, as although the duration of Drizzle was shortened to five turns, the rain it brings helps mitigate Ferrothorn's weakness to Fire-type moves. In return, Ferrothorn's Spikes help Kyogre secure KOs and wear down its chief check, Palkia. Ferrothorn can readily switch in on Electric- and Grass-type moves aimed at Kyogre and also use Toxic to wear down bulky checks to Kyogre, such as Grass Arceus. Clerics such as Chansey, Blissey, and Xerneas are excellent partners as well, especially for Leech Seed variants of Ferrothorn, which are very susceptible to burns. Clerics are also beneficial for Rest variants, as they can wake Ferrothorn up immediately if it needs to heal, though it should be noted that Ferrothorn is fairly good at finding free turns to wake up on its own. Ferrothorn is incinerated by Fire-type moves, so it can bait these attacks and give Ho-Oh, Kyogre, Heatran, and most Dragon-types an opportunity to switch in. Fairy-types, Ho-Oh, and Giratina can serve as decent partners too, as they can switch in on Fighting-type moves aimed at Ferrothorn and force switches, either through offensive presence or phazing, to rack up entry hazard damage. Ho-Oh is a major threat to Ferrothorn, so a partner such as Rock Arceus that can check it is appreciated. A teammate with access to a speedy Taunt can be helpful in preventing an opponent's Defog from clearing Ferrothorn's precious Spikes, ensuring that it does not set up in vain. Sweepers in general serve as great teammates, as they can use the entry hazards that Ferrothorn sets to secure OHKOs and 2HKOs, and they appreciate Ferrothorn using Toxic to wear down walls they cannot beat alone."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Leftovers"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 252, "Attack": 4, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 252, "Speed": 0}, "Natures": [22], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Gyro Ball", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Leech Seed", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Rest", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Power Whip", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Toxic", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Spikes", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Stealth Rock", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Utility"}, {"Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Iron Barbs"}], "Description": [{"Content": "Protect and Leech Seed will help keep Ferrothorn healthy as well as harass opponents."}, {"Content": "Protect can be useful for scouting attacks that other Pokemon are using and help against Choice users."}, {"Content": "You can utilize Thunder Wave to harass potential switch-ins such as Charizard and Heatran."}, {"Content": "Gryo Ball can help Ferrothorn tackle threats thanks to its awesome defensive typing.

As a priority move, it remedies Azumarill's poor Speed stat and helps chip off HP from weakened opponents. Aqua Jet has decent power, letting Azumarill take down even mildly weakened opponents and making it a very reliable revenge killer. Play Rough and Waterfall are next on the list as Azumarill's main STAB attacks. Both hit with a lot of power, have good coverage, and have useful secondary effects. When Azumarill holds a Choice Band, few Pokemon can sponge multiple attacks from it unless they resist its chosen move. The last slot is only for coverage on specific threats, as Azumarill's STAB moves do more damage most of the time. Ice Punch hits Grass-types, most notably Amoonguss, which would otherwise wall this set. Superpower smacks Steel-types, namely Ferrothorn, and OHKOes Mega Kangaskhan. However, it's riskier to be locked into Superpower, so it should only be used in those specific situations."}, {"Content": "Choice Band is used to grant an immediate boost to Azumarill's Attack stat, giving it explosive power and the ability to revenge kill a much wider range of opponents. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature make Azumarill as powerful as possible, and the Speed EVs let it outspeed uninvested base 61s and below, beating key threats such as Tyranitar. The remaining EVs are put into HP for additional bulk."}, {"Content": "In contrast with the Belly Drum set, this set's purpose is to deal as much damage as possible as quickly as possible without the need to set up first. Azumarill's powerful Aqua Jet makes it a powerful revenge killer capable of taking down a lot of neutral targets with moderate health. Due to its destructive nature, it is possible to play a little more recklessly with this set and let it punch major holes in opposing teams. Be careful, however, as this set is a lot more vulnerable to offensive strategies than the Belly Drum set is. It simply needs to take advantage of opportunities presented to fire off powerful STAB attacks at its opponents. A hit-and-run playstyle can also be used to great effect. As with all Choice-locked Pokemon, partner support is key to cover for Azumarill's weaknesses once its job is done and to ward off potential counters."}, {"Content": "The Choice Band set relies heavily on partner support. Because Azumarill is susceptible to opposing type advantages after revealing its set, teammates that can tackle Grass-, Steel-, and Poison-types are highly recommended. Fire-types are great partners, and Heatran in particular supports Azumarill well with its powerful Heat Wave, blasting away Steel- and Grass-types that Azumarill lures in. Trick Room setters are also great partners for this set, as the field effect helps mitigate Azumarill's low Speed. Heatran again pairs particularly well with Azumarill in Trick Room, and together they make a very capable offensive core. Azumarill can aid Fire-types by warding off Ground-, Rock-, Dragon-, and Fire-types. Partners that can handle Electric-types are great as well. Ground-types such as Landorus-T help take down Electric- and Steel-types, and can use Intimidate to lower the opponents' Attack. This set doesn't require setup opportunities, but it does appreciate lures that buy it opportunities to hit hard. Dual screens setters are helpful as they increase Azumarill's bulk, making it easier to switch in and out. Helping Hand users can boost Azumarill's power and help it reach some key KOs and revenge kill a greater number of Pokemon. Jirachi provides Azumarill with lots of useful support, as it walls Grass- and Poison-type opponents and can offer Follow Me, dual screens, Helping Hand, Trick Room, and speed control support.

Waterfall is the secondary Water-type STAB attack that has near-perfect coverage with Play Rough. It has better accuracy than Play Rough and almost as much power, and is generally a more reliable move. Belly Drum can be used in this slot instead, giving Azumarill a high risk, high reward setup move that will quickly enable it to deal even more damage than before. With adequate team support, Azumarill can use this move to boost its Attack to insane levels and easily OHKO many opponents. Aqua Jet rounds off Azumarill's offensive arsenal by quickly taking down weakened foes, making up for its middling Speed stat and helping it function as a great revenge killer.

The rest of the EVs are stashed into HP for rounded bulk. Sitrus Berry is used to give Azumarill a bit more longevity, healing 25% of its HP once it's whittled down to below 50%, helping it recover from Belly Drum. Azumarill's natural bulk allows it to survive most neutral attacks, and the Sitrus Berry can often turn 2HKOs into 3HKOs by boosting Azumarill's total usable HP. Lum Berry can also be used to help Azumarill heal off status conditions if necessary. A spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def is preferred for the Belly Drum route, which would appreciate the extra bulk to successfully pull off this costly set up."}, {"Content": "Due to its below-average Speed, Azumarill really requires partner support in order to shine.

Due to its typing advantage, it's a good idea to use Azumarill to bait common Intimidate users such as Hitmontop, Landorus-T, and Scrafty and KO them with super effective STAB moves. It's generally best to play Azumarill as a hit-and-run attacker (unless it's running Belly Drum) due to its low Speed and high attack power. It isn't really as much of a flat-out sweeper as it is a revenge killer and pivot."}, {"Content": "Hitmontop is a great partner for Azumarill, as Fake Out and Intimidate buy it a lot of time and bulk, increasing its longevity. Hitmontop also has Wide Guard, which is useful in stopping opposing Discharge users. Other Intimidate users such as Scrafty and Landorus-T are great partners as well. Partners that can target Electric-, Poison-, and Grass-types are really useful to help cover Azumarill's weaknesses. Ground-types are notable partners as Earthquake can target multiple threats at once while Azumarill uses Protect. Azumarill loves the company of status users: it greatly appreciates paralysis support as well as the free turns it can get from a partner's Spore. Rage Powder/Follow Me users are vital for Azumarill's success should it use Belly Drum, as they can redirect attacks and give it the valuable window it needs to set up safely. Amoonguss is a notable user as it walls Electric-types and can spread status, but unfortunately, it can't do much against Grass-types. This set could also work well with Trick Room, as Azumarill's low Speed makes it very fast while the field effect is active. If run with Trick Room support, Azumarill should use a Brave nature with minimum Speed investment. Dual screens users are helpful as they increase Azumarill's bulk, allowing it an easier setting up. Helping Hand users can boost Azumarill's power, helping it reach some key KOs and revenge kill a greater number of Pokemon. Jirachi is an awesome partner because it can provide Azumarill with Follow Me, Trick Room, Helping Hand, Speed control, and dual screens support, while also walling Grass- and Poison-types.

What makes Arceus scary to offensive teams is that those Pokemon that can kill Arceus tend to be ripped to shreds by Extreme Speed, while those that can take Extreme Speed tend to either be too slow, in which case they are destroyed by coverage moves, or they are too weak to take down Arceus. This is not to say that Arceus is invincible (far from it), but He does force the opponent to pack either a relatively hard counter or a loose group of checks to make sure that Arceus does not sweep them. Arceus's role is not just limited to that of a sweeper, either. His strong priority allow it to take down a lot of frail or weakened threats, for example, Blaziken. If He is packing Magic Coat, He can also serve as a very good anti-lead, bouncing back entry hazards or just picking off the opponent with Extreme Speed."}, {"Content": "Please don't be single-track-minded and just send Arceus in at the earliest opportunity to set up and attack.

Should your opponent still have a Giratina, Lugia, or any other physically bulky wall, you're just going to end up getting Arceus crippled. It also means that while Arceus is bulky, you also have to know the limits of what He can take, and potentially how much damage He needs to sweep. Setting Arceus up on a Kyogre that is in the middle of spamming Water Spout is just going to result in a dead Arceus. It also means that if your opponent potentially still has a Pokemon that can tank an Extreme Speed and chip Arceus, that even tanking Surf from Kyogre might be a bad idea. When Arceus looks so scary on paper, people often tend to give into hubris and make a mockery of themselves. They fail to recognize that while Arceus looks amazing on paper, He has some serious limitations in practice. Most notably, Extreme Speed, for all its priority, is actually not that strong. Anything remotely physically bulky can take one and stop Arceus from sweeping. A Pokemon like physically defensive Ho-Oh can tank a +2 Extreme Speed and hit back hard with Sacred Fire, potentially crippling Arceus in the process. That being said, if you are smart with using Arceus and expecting to sweep with it only when you've lured out and crippled its checks, there really is no other Pokemon that can get the job done like Extreme Killer Arceus."}, {"Content": "Arceus has a number of EV spreads that He can run.

Lum Berry allows Arceus to avoid status from Will-O-Wisp wielding support Arceus. It is very important to note that Arceus is very weak with a Lum Berry, so you really need to weaken the opposing team before you try to sweep. Life Orb is preferred if are you using a Jolly nature to offset the drop in power. It is also better on sets using Overheat to give it the extra kick needed to take down Skarmory. Silk Scarf is a good option to boost the power of Extreme Speed without the recoil, and is a decent option on variants using Magic Coat.

To give an idea of Draco Meteor's power, Darkrai is OHKOed while defensive Yveltal is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Draco Meteor also strips off a huge chunk of health from common switch-ins expecting a physical set. For example, Gliscor is usually OHKOed by Draco Meteor unless it is running significant Special Defense investment. Shadow Sneak is unarguably the best move Giratina-O has access to on any set and is able to 2HKO most Pokemon weak to it, most notably Mega Mewtwo Y. Dragon Tail can be used to phaze boosting sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage in the process, while also dealing a solid amount of damage itself. However, Shadow Ball can be used in its place as a consistent and reliable STAB move that does not lower Giratina-O's Special Attack nor leave it helpless against Fairy-types. It's also useful against Steel-types, which would otherwise wall this set."}, {"Content": "Like the previous set, the last slot is extremely flexible. Toxic can put a timer on Ho-Oh and Fairy-type switch-ins, while Defog can be used to clear hazards and dual screens. Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are different status options that can be used to neuter physically based and fast switch-ins, respectively. They're also useful against Pokemon that might stay in and attempt to boost against Giratina-O. Several damaging moves are usable as well. Earthquake is an option against Heatran and other Steel-types if Giratina-O is not running Shadow Ball. Stone Edge can be used to OHKO Ho-Oh. Finally, Thunder can be used if your team struggles versus Kyogre."}, {"Content": "The purpose of running maximum Special Attack investment is fairly straightforward, as doing so allows Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball to hit as hard as possible and guarantees the damage outputs mentioned above. 76 Speed EVs are used for Giratina-O to outrun defensive Yveltal, while also making it faster than uninvested Gliscor and Landorus-T. A minimum of 108 Attack EVs is required in order to guarantee the 2HKO on Mega Mewtwo Y with Shadow Sneak, and the remaining EVs are also placed in Attack to increase the power of Shadow Sneak and Dragon Tail."}, {"Content": "Appropriate usage of Draco Meteor is what makes or breaks this set. If you predict that your opponent will switch in a Fairy-type, do not mindlessly throw it out; doing so will render Giratina-O complete setup bait and/or force it to switch out. It is key to lure in other common switch-ins, however, and smack them with a Draco Meteor. The combination of Draco Meteor and Shadow Sneak is capable of dealing with even more threats than those already mentioned, including Mega Mewtwo X and offensive Dialga. By itself, Shadow Sneak is still incredibly handy, and should be used to pick off weakened foes and check Pokemon that are weak to it. Dragon Tail in conjunction with hazard support is extremely useful for weakening the opponent's team as well as checking boosting sweepers; once again, if you need a healthy Giratina-O to check a Pokemon your opponent has, do not let it get worn down by constantly switching it in on resisted hits. If Shadow Ball is used instead, it is usually a much safer move to start with than Draco Meteor, since the only Normal-type in Ubers that has any business switching in on Giratina-O is Blissey. It should also be used in situations where Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop could otherwise be taken advantage of, namely against Substitute users. As with the previous set, use the move chosen for the fourth slot when necessary."}, {"Content": "Stealth Rock support is practically mandatory when using this set, as it guarantees specific OHKOs and 2HKOs with Draco Meteor and Shadow Sneak. These include OHKOs on Gliscor and offensive Yveltal and 2HKOs on Landorus-T and Ho-Oh. Stealth Rock support also aids Dragon Tail shuffling quite a bit. Thus, dedicated Stealth Rock users such as Groudon and Dialga make good teammates, with Groudon's physical walling capabilities again coming in handy against physically based Dragon-types. Giratina-O can also remove the aforementioned Landorus-T and Gliscor and even opposing Giratina-O, allowing offensive Groudon to sweep."}, {"Content": "Ultimately, most of the teammates suggested for the previous set also pair well with this one. Steel-types such as Scizor, Klefki, Aegislash, Steel Arceus, Bronzong, Metagross, and Jirachi can keep opposing Fairy-types in check; the last four of these are also able to set up Stealth Rock, while Klefki can set up Spikes. Additionally, the listed Steel-types that are weak to Dark-type moves greatly benefit from the removal of Darkrai and Yveltal. Heatran is a particularly helpful Steel-type teammate, being immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Toxic and having access to Stealth Rock. It can also deal with opposing Steel-types and Ho-Oh, provided Ho-Oh is not running Earthquake. Tyranitar easily defeats Dark-types that lack a Fighting-type move, while also being able to set up Stealth Rock and Pursuit trap wallbreakers that threaten Giratina-O.

Shadow Sneak is a solid priority STAB move that is able to nail the numerous Psychic- and Ghost-types that litter the metagame for super effective damage, and is made even stronger by Griseous Orb. Dragon Tail completes Giratina-O's combo of utility STAB moves, dealing a fair amount of damage and allowing it to phaze any Pokemon that is not a Fairy-type or behind a Substitute. Will-O-Wisp is the optimal choice in the final slot, allowing Giratina-O to incapacitate physical attackers and add a source of consistent residual damage to its opponents.

Otherwise, it should fire off its STAB moves, using Shadow Sneak to pick off weakened Pokemon and against those that it hits super effectively. Dragon Tail should be used sparingly if your opponent has a Fairy-type waiting in the wings, but is otherwise your go-to attacking option. As Dragon Tail greatly benefits from having your own entry hazards up, it's often wise to avoid using Defog immediately, if at all. The move chosen for the fourth slot should be used as needed."}, {"Content": "Because it lacks reliable recovery, keeping Giratina-O healthy rather than continuously switching into Stealth Rock and using Defog is crucial if it is your only check to a specific Pokemon on your opponent's team. Similarly, if you require Giratina-O's Shadow Sneak to deal with threats such as Deoxys-A, make sure it is not mindlessly switched in and worn down."}, {"Content": "Naturally, Pokemon that appreciate Defog support are obvious choices for potential teammates. Ho-Oh in particular stands out as an excellent teammate for Defog Giratina-O, having great defensive synergy with it; Ho-Oh can take the special Dark-, Ghost-, Dragon-, Ice-, and Fairy-type attacks and Will-O-Wisps aimed at Giratina-O, which in turn can sponge Water-, Electric-, and most Rock-type attacks. As previously mentioned, Stealth Rock support complements Dragon Tail nicely, making dedicated Stealth Rock users such as Dialga and Groudon great teammates. Groudon can also wall many of the physically inclined Dragon-types that force Giratina-O out, such as Zekrom and Garchomp. Pokemon that handle Fairy-types well also make good teammates. Steel Arceus, Scizor, Aegislash, Bronzong, Metagross, and Jirachi stand out, all of which also have a useful Dragon-type resistance and four of which can set up Stealth Rock. Poison Arceus works similarly against Fairies, especially if it has Roar for Geomancy Xerneas. Klefki can annoy Dark- and Fairy-types and provide Spikes support, while Tyranitar defeats Dark-types that lack a Fighting-type move, can set up Stealth Rock, and is able to Pursuit trap dangerous wallbreakers such as Choice-locked Kyurem-W. Heatran walls Ho-Oh without Earthquake, can beat most Steel-types, gets a Flash Fire Boost from Will-O-Wisp, is immune to Toxic, and can deal with Fairy-types that lack the appropriate coverage move."}, {"Content": "Calm Mind and Swords Dance Arceus formes warrant a special mention. Thanks to the Defog support Giratina-O provides, they can switch in and boost without being plagued by entry hazards.

However, be very cautious of using this move as you lose Landorus-T after using it, and be very vary of the Pokemon which remain on your opponents team; especially Steel-, Ghost-, and Rock- types.

However, don't use this as an Extreme Killer Arceus check, as if Landorus-T is even a bit weakened, Extreme Killer can rip right through this, leaving you in a bad spot.

As always, a cleric is really useful, as if Landorus-T is burnt, it is essentially ruined. Since this set doesn't carry Stealth Rocks, have another Pokemon with dissimilar weaknesses as Landorus-T. Also, since you will be locked into a move that will give your opponent free turns a lot of the times, it is pivotal for your team to have a good backbone and defensive switch-ins. Water Arceus and specially defensive Kyogre are good teammates, as they can take on many special attacks aimed at Landorus-T, while Landorus-T is immune to the Electric- type moves that give those two Pokemon trouble. Blissey and Xerneas are also teammates that can work well with this Landorus-T, as they can offer both cleric support should Landrous-T get burnt, while also providing a specially defensive backbone.

Explosion is an option in the fourth move slot, as it is considerably stronger than a super effective Stone Edge or neutral Earthquake, so it can get some surprise kills.

Furthermore, Landorus-T's typing and access to Intimidate grant it the ability to combat some of the most common priority attacks in the game, such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, Lucario's Extreme Speed, and Scizor's Bullet Punch, allowing Landorus-T to differentiate itself from other users of Choice Scarf, which normally struggle against priority users. As with most good Choice Scarf users, Landorus-T plays an effective role as a revenge killer, but thanks to its massive Attack stat and Intimidate, which often forces switches, it is just as well-versed mid-game as it is late-game. The ability to predict switch-ins is vital, as the correct selection of Stone Edge or a another coverage move could quickly spell the end of a check, opening a clean-up opportunity with Earthquake later in the match. A fast U-turn should never be neglected either; backed with Landorus-T's massive Attack, U-turn can quickly knock out weakened foes and allow for a quick switch-in, generating offensive momentum. However, when U-Turn knocks out a foe, it gives the opponent switch advantage. While it might be tempting to abuse a fast and powerful Earthquake or a strong Stone Edge, keep in mind that Choice Scarf locks Landorus-T into one move; Earthquake's predictability and Stone Edge's accuracy issues can be exploited by smart players, so using this set to the best of its ability requires smart decision-making and paying careful attention to the opposing team."}, {"Content": "As this set lacks any form of recovery, the removal of Stealth Rock is a great asset for Landorus-T, allowing it to switch in multiple times without the fear of repeated entry hazard damage.

Swords Dance, on the other hand, doubles its already massive Attack, making it an effective wallbreaker that can deal with even the bulkiest of checks. Earthquake and Stone Edge provide excellent coverage by themselves, allowing neutral hits on most Pokemon outside of Breloom and Chesnaught. A boosted STAB Earthquake will put a dent in nearly anything, however, and most things that resist or are immune to Earthquake are dispatched handily by Stone Edge.

Use Swords Dance if the opposing team is more defensive or stall-based, punching massive holes in bulky threats that would normally take Landorus-T's attacks with ease. While scoring a Rock Polish and a Swords Dance at the same time is tempting, Landorus-T often cannot afford the time it takes to set up both.

Gliscor, Skarmory, Chesnaught, Hippowdon and opposing Landorus and Landorus-T can come in fairly easily and either deal heavy damage or force Landorus-T out. Greninja makes an excellent offensive partner, utilizing its Protean ability to defeat almost all of these physical threats with ease due to their low Special Defense and weaknesses to Water- and Ice-type attacks.

The last move directly correlates to specific checks that need disposing of.

Knock Off is an excellent support move, removing items such as Skarmory's Leftovers, Chansey's Eviolite, and Choice Scarf from some opposing checks, while potentially 2HKOing other would-be checks such as Trevenant, Bronzong, and Gourgeist-S. Hidden Power Ice may seem like an odd choice given Landorus-T's massive Attack stat, but its good base 105 Special Attack allows Hidden Power Ice to hit Gliscor, opposing Landorus and Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite hard. Stone Edge isn't the only Rock-type move Landorus-T can put to good use. Smack Down pressures common Defog users such as Zapdos and Skarmory by making them vulnerable to Earthquake.

It can also bluff a Choice Scarf with it."}, {"Content": "As the title suggests, this set gives Landorus-T the ability to be one of the best offensive pivots in the metagame, utilizing its key immunities and resistances in conjunction with Intimidate to switch in on opposing Pokemon and force the opponent to switch to a Landorus-T check, as they risk taking heavy damage or giving Landorus-T an easy opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. As a result of this, Landorus-T creates a domino effect, enabling teammates to switch in right after and eliminate opposing Pokemon that Landorus-T can't handle by itself. U-turn plays a vital role in this, dealing additional damage while giving teammates a free opportunity to switch in with potentially little consequence. The offensive pivot set can be used in all stages of battle effectively, but it finds its greatest use in the early and middle portions of the game, where it can find opportunities to set up Stealth Rock as often as possible and create momentum for its teammates. Once Stealth Rock is up, Landorus-T should focus on utilizing its powerful STAB Earthquake to punch holes in opposing teams or U-turning to scout switch-ins and provide setup opportunities for teammates. Keep an eye out for Landorus-T checks as the game progresses, using Landorus-T's coverage move of choice when an expected check or counter switches in. Removing checks early on could mean all the difference for Landorus-T later on in the match."}, {"Content": "Rotom-W is the perfect partner in crime for this set, resisting both of Landorus-T's weaknesses and using Volt Switch to create an effective VoltTurn core. Rotom-W is also equipped to dispatch most of Landorus-T's checks as well, including opposing Ground / Flying Pokemon and physical walls such as Skarmory and Hippowdon. Similarly, bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Mega Blastoise can switch in on resisted attacks and provide support for Landorus-T and the rest of the team. Wish users such as Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Chansey are very helpful for Landorus-T, granting it another form of recovery as the match progresses. This set forces many switches throughout the duration of a match and chips away at opposing Pokemon with U-turn, so entry hazards support is always a boon. While Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock on its own, Spikes support from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory can greatly help out with racking up damage throughout the match."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Leftovers"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Rocky Helmet"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 252, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 252, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 4}, "Natures": [10], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Stealth Rock", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earthquake", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "U-turn", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Knock Off", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Stone Edge", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Offensive Pivot"}, {"Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Intimidate"}], "Description": [{"Content": "Earthquake is a strong STAB spread move that is can deal major damage to both opponents on the field.

Life Orb is also an option to boost Landorus-T's damage tremendously and give it a major offensive presence, however the 10% recoil may be unattractive. Sitrus Berry is a last option to allow greater longevity for Landorus-T, allowing it to survive more hits and thus have more turns to deal damage. Intimidate helps neutralise both physical attackers on the opponent's field and give your teammates greater leeway and reduce damage taken.

Stone Edge is there to hit what Earthquake cannot, so that Pokemon with Levitate or Flying typing don't completely wall this set. However, if Stone Edge isn't doing super effective damage, it won't be doing much due to lack of STAB and Attack investment. Toxic is an excellent move for Landorus-T, allowing it to put pressure on Pokemon that otherwise like to switch in on it, such as Hippowdon, Groudon, Lugia, support Arceus, and other Landorus-T. Toxic also prevents support Arceus from being able to stay in and constantly Defog away your Stealth Rock, and in general prevents walls from having the ability to constantly recover in front of you.

Some examples of mixed attackers could be Swords Dance Ground Arceus and Mega Mewtwo-X carrying Ice Beam, and Life Orb Zekrom, all of which do a lot to Landorus-T, if not flat out OHKO it. In terms of countering Extreme Killer Arceus, despite being physically defensive it cannot actually beat a full health Extreme Killer, as Landorus-T cannot phase it out and due to good bulk, Extreme Killer can set up again.

A cleric is also very useful since Landorus-T doesn't have any form of healing itself, from either status or its HP. Having a cleric which is a Fairy type, like Sylveon and Xerenas, also gives your team dual immunity to Zekrom. Specially defensive Kyogre makes a great partner, as it can tank most special attacks and status ailments aimed at Landorus-T, and can phase as well. Water Arceus also resists Ice and Water attacks, and has good typing synergy with Landorus-T in terms of Electric- type moves.

The last move can be a bit of a toss up; Swords Dance is an excellent move which boosts Landorus-T's Attack stat even further, but may be hard to set up alongside Rock Polish. Explosion is an another amazing option, doing up to 90% on Max HP Arceus. Furthermore, Explosion prevents both a Rapid Spin and a potential Defog due to there being no target for the Pokemon to use the move on. Hidden Power Ice is mainly to be used only if you want this set to significantly damage other Landorus-T and Gliscor as otherwise this set is walled significantly by them."}, {"Content": "The Attack stat is maxed out so it can do as much damage after either boost as fast as possible, while the Speed EVs allow it to outspeed all base 100 Speed Choice Scarf users and below after a Rock Polish boost.

If you are using Hidden Power Ice as the final move, a Naughty nature can also be used so that Hidden Power Ice's power isn't weakened. Life Orb is the prime choice for this set as it gives a large power boost to Landorus-T, allowing it to have a large chance to OHKO common Uber Pokemon if Stealth Rocks is up, and also boosts the power of Hidden Power Ice if you choose to use it. Another item that can be considered on this set is Lum Berry. Lum Berry allows Landorus-T to set up on Pokemon that would otherwise just status it, thus allowing for more set up opportunities. One final item that can be considered if Swords Dance is used is Leftovers. While seemingly odd, Leftovers allows even this variant of Landorus-T to act as a semi-defensive pivot, while also allowing Landorus-T to set up against other Landorus-T and walls lacking Toxic or Will-O-Wisp.

Groudon has better overall bulk to take on priority, and a slightly higher Attack stat as well. That being said, when using this set, it is not necessary to set up with both moves, and you should take a close look at your opponent's team before deciding on which boost to use. Set up Rock Polish against Heavy Offensive teams, and Swords Dance against bulky/stall teams. However, you will need both boosts to get past balanced teams. On another note, don't try setting up if there is a Pokemon on your opponents team that can force out Landorus-T without taking much damage themselves in the process, most notably Giratina-O, Gliscor, and other Landorus-T (unless Landorus-T carries Hidden Power Ice, in which case Gliscor an Landorus-T are significantly easier to deal with). Naturally, don't try to set up in front of something that can flat out OHKO Landorus-T. Your best bet is to set up on a Pokemon that can't hurt Landorus-T much, or something you know your opponent will switch out.

Mega Gengar can be used to trap support Arceus, and in general, trap anything that might be able to stop Landorus-T's sweep. Dual screen support is useful, as it allows Landorus-T to set up much easier, with Klefki and Deoxys being two usable dual screens user which can pair up with Landorus-T. Wobuffet can also help Landorus-T set up through the use of Encore and Safeguard. If you chose to run Hidden Power Ice on this set, Zekrom is an excellent partner as Landorus-T can lure common Ground types in and attempt to knock them out, paving the way for a Zekrom rampage.

Do note, however, that Goodra hates being Toxiced by Heatran."}, {"Content": "The EVs on this set are relatively straightforward. 248 HP EVs give Goodra the best defensive capability as well as a Stealth Rock number, and max Special Attack investment allows it to function as a tank by being able to dish out a ton of damage. Choosing a Quiet nature reinforces this by ensuring Goodra does the most damage with all of its attacks, both special and physical. On the other hand, a Modest nature can also be chosen to avoid the speed drop of Quiet. This allows Goodra to outspeed a few threats that sit in between, such as minimum Speed Mega Scizor and Heatran. If Modest is being used, it is recommended to use 16 Speed EVs to outspeed max Speed Adamant Azumarill and Mega Mawile. For slightly more defense and slightly less offense, a Sassy or Calm nature can be chosen instead. Sap Sipper gives Goodra an immunity, which is extremely welcome on a Pokemon with no recovery, and allows it to come in unscathed on a predicted Grass-type attack. Sap Sipper also makes it immune to Spore, Stun Spore, Sleep Powder, and Leech Seed, all the while powering up Dragon Tail. While Gooey can be quite useful to potentially turn the tide of the battle in your favor, the main downside of it is that in order to activate it, Goodra has to take a contact hit. Since most contact hits are physical, letting Goodra take those hits in order to activate Gooey will drastically decrease its lifespan. It can also activate Defiant on the likes of Bisharp, meaning it can actually be detrimental. That being said, Gooey can be helpful to switch in on a random resisted contact hit or as a last-ditch effort to stop an opponent's sweep. Assault Vest is the item of choice on Goodra, as it helps to raise Goodra's special bulk to even higher levels.

Wish support is also useful because of Goodra's complete lack of reliable recovery, making Chansey and Sylveon helpful partners. Goodra has good defensive synergy with Heatran, who resists all of its weaknesses and together with Goodra forms a solid special defensive core.

A better play would be to double switch or just scout with Substitute or Protect. Speaking of Protect, use it wisely, as a skilled player can predict when you use it and use the free turn to either switch or set up. Substitute protects Gourgeist-S from Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Chansey that are only threatening through status, so get a Substitute up against them first. Getting a Substitute up on anything that commonly carries status moves should come before anything else, because Gourgeist-S really hates being burned or poisoned.

Judgment is Ghost Arceus's reliable, powerful STAB move. Recover aids Ghost Arceus in setting up multiple Calm Mind boosts. Will-O-Wisp allows Ghost Arceus to check physical threats like Groudon and Mega Kangaskhan, even as it sets up. In conjunction with its max HP EVs, Ghost Arceus can also burn Extreme Killer Arceus and switch out to a relevant teammate relatively unscathed. Note that with its respectable natural bulk, possible Calm Mind boosts, and lack of weaknesses to most common offensive types, running Will-O-Wisp can make Ghost Arceus very difficult to break with both physical and special attacks, enhancing its ability to accrue multiple boosts (watch out for opposing status-inducing moves though). Also, with the buff to the Ghost typing, forgoing a coverage move becomes much less of an issue. Focus Blast can be run for hitting Arceus-Normal super effectively and landing a stronger hit on Ferrothorn and Heatran, possibly preventing them from using a status move or, in Heatran's case, Roar. However, its rather high 30% miss chance, along with the fact that Steel-type Pokemon now take neutral damage from Ghost-type moves, make it a less desirable option. Alternatively, Thunder can be run over Focus Blast as it hits important targets in Kyogre, Yveltal, and Ho-Oh significantly harder, potentially killing them before they can damage Arceus. Keep in mind though that Thunder has similar accuracy to Focus Blast, and that running it means you miss out on running Will-O-Wisp/Focus Blast, which might be more useful for your team. Rain support from Kyogre is recommended if Thunder is used."}, {"Content": "Maximum HP investment preserves Ghost Arceus's natural bulk, allowing it to comfortably take moderately powerful hits as it sets up, such as Hydro Pump from Palkia in neutral weather. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature allows Ghost Arceus to outspeed everything below its Speed tier and Speed tie with other Arceus formes. An alternative spread of 144 HP / 252 SpA / 112 Speed with a Timid nature can be used to let Arceus outspeed everything up to Jolly Garchomp; maximum Special Attack EVs allow Judgment to hit as hard as possible from the get-go. The remaining 144 EVs are invested in HP in order to let Ghost Arceus take hits a little better as it sets up. A third possible set would be 252 SpA / 252 Spe for maximum Speed and initial power. This set is more oriented toward posing an immediate threat, while 252 HP / 252 Spe increases Ghost Arceus's ability to take hits while accruing multiple boosts."}, {"Content": "If you see weakened threats, pick them off with Judgment. Also, use Judgment to ensure opposing sweepers vulnerable to it, such as Mewtwo, don't set up on Arceus. Basically, don't be hesitant to spam Judgment. Secondly, it is effective to actively make aggressive double switches. If the opponent is likely to switch to their Mewtwo, don't be afraid to double switch into Ghost Arceus. Ghost Arceus can take most unboosted hits comfortably, so one should not be too worried about the occasional mispredict (again, watch out for status, though). On the other hand, don't be too eager to set up Calm Mind rashly early-to-mid-game. While being gifted with natural bulk, Ghost Arceus is no damage sponge. For example, an unboosted Ghost Arceus might be able to set up a Calm Mind and come out on top of a skirmish with an Adamant-natured Groudon, but it will accomplish this with at most 24% of its HP to spare, leaving it prone to being revenge killed by threats it could otherwise beat, such as Mewtwo or Aegislash running Shadow Sneak. That aside, this set also loathes status, as mentioned above. Burn and poison limit its longevity greatly, and paralysis gimps its great Speed. This makes it unwise to set up on threats you can ultimately kill but which will cripple you with status in the process, limiting your staying power and sweeping potential. Examples include Ferrothorn and Heatran. Also, be very wary of Yveltal and Darkrai; both are Pokemon that can rapidly snatch momentum away. Yveltal can switch into a Judgment and proceed to threaten your team massively with its possible Life Orb-boosted dual STAB moves. While Darkrai is too frail to be switching into Judgment repeatedly, it can take one and threaten to put something to sleep or set up."}, {"Content": "Make sure Dark-types like Yveltal and Darkrai are adequately dealt with. Fairy-types pair well with Ghost Arceus. Xerneas can take hits directed at it, as well as rid it of status with a bulky cleric set. Other Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Clefable are also viable teammates as they, too, provide type synergy and cleric support. However, do note that Fairy-types are both friend and foe to Ghost Arceus; it is crucial to have a reliable answer to a boosted Geomancy Xerneas as it can set up alongside with and overpower this set. Scizor can use Bullet Punch to pick off Xerneas that have taken prior damage from Judgment. Pokemon such as Bronzong and Jirachi can also reliably handle Geomancy Xerneas, but note that these compound the team's Ghost-type weakness. Ho-Oh is problematic for this set as its powerful dual STAB moves outdamage Ghost Arceus and prevent it from setting up; have teammates that can set up Stealth Rock reliably such that Ho-Oh loses 50% of its total HP upon each switch-in. Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Gliscor are good Stealth Rock setters that can also check Ho-Oh with their physical bulk when the need arises. However, note that neither can switch into Brave Bird/Sacred Fire repeatedly and the best way to keep Ho-Oh in check is really to make sure Stealth Rock stays up; a Judgment at +1 Special Attack from 0 SpA Ghost Arceus will always kill 248 HP Ho-Oh after it takes Stealth Rock damage and a round of Life Orb recoil. Thirdly, Ghost Arceus is vulnerable to powerful Choice Scarf users after it has gotten a kill. Choice Scarf Zekrom is a threat that can be dealt with by the aforementioned Landorus-T and Gliscor. Groudon can also be used if its lack of a Ground immunity is not an issue, and if teammates can take advantage of the sun it provides. Choice Scarf Kyogre is less of a threat if Ghost Arceus has gotten at least one Calm Mind boost, but a Water Spout at full or near-full HP is nonetheless incredibly threatening; Palkia is a good teammate to handle Kyogre. Finally, it would be pertinent to mention that this set's usage over another Arceus forme should be well-justified. For example, this set checks Mewtwo, so it would be a good addition to teams that are weak to Mewtwo. On the other hand, this set might not be the best addition to teams already vulnerable to opportunistic Dark-types like Darkrai. Notably, this set's draws over another Calm Mind Arceus forme should be evaluated. For example, if a team were weak to Mega Kangaskhan, running this set over a Calm Mind Arceus-Electric would be a good decision."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Spooky Plate"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 4, "HP": 252, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [24], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Calm Mind", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Judgment", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Recover", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Focus Blast", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Thunder", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Will-O-Wisp", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Calm Mind"}, {"Abilities": [], "Description": [{"Content": "Judgment is the obligatory STAB move.

Augmented by the Ghost buff, Shadow Force hits like a nuke, and at +2 Attack will KO virtually all Pokemon that do not resist or are immune to it, especially after Stealth Rock. Shadow Claw prevents Substitute/Protect users, such as Substitute Ho-Oh, from taking advantage of Shadow Force. With the buff to Ghost typing, running two Ghost-type moves is very viable, akin to not running a coverage move on the Calm Mind set. Brick Break in the last slot allows Ghost Arceus to hit Normal-types like Chansey and Kangaskhan that are immune to Ghost Arceus's STAB moves. It also hits Ferrothorn super effectively, and allows Ghost Arceus to come out on top against Extreme Killer Arceus. Recover can be used in the third or fourth moveslot, but it is not recommended, as running it in either slot will give you Arceus sub-optimal coverage. This set aims to pull off a quick, brutal sweep late-game, making Recover an inferior option, as opposed to on Calm Mind Ghost Arceus, which aims to stay healthy while possibly accruing multiple boosts. Extreme Speed can be run over Shadow Claw, as it hits pretty hard at +2 and can pick off annoying, fast but frail threats like Deoxys-A, Darkrai, and Blaziken, as well as weaknened Choice Scarf users. However, note that even after a Swords Dance, Extreme Speed is still a relatively weak move that does not hit anything super effectively, and is generally outclassed in usefulness by the listed moves. Stone Edge can be used in the third moveslot to nail Yveltal and Ho-Oh, notably the physically defensive variant; this is situationally useful and should only be run if one's team dearly needs these Pokemon out of the way."}, {"Content": "Maximum Attack investment optimizes damage output.

One of the main contributing factors to this set's effectiveness is the element of surprise, so try not to foil your opportunity. However, if the opponent's Choice Scarfed Pokemon is likely to stick around (for example, if they are saving their Kyogre for a late-game sweep), the best course of action would be to sneak Ghost Arceus in whenever opportunities present themselves, either by double switching or on weaker hits, and spam Shadow Force, or otherwise attempt to do as much damage as possible. Again, be very wary of Dark-types like Yveltal and Darkrai. Don't spam Shadow Force if they are healthy, as they can take a hit and force you to relinquish momentum."}, {"Content": "Make sure Dark-types can be reliably handled.

Sticky Web support is huge for this set, as it ensures that Choice Scarf users cannot revenge kill it, and provides it a lot more room to maneuver around the opponent. There is a chance that this set will lose to Extreme Killer Arceus one-on-one, and if so, there needs to be a reliable contingency plan. Support Groudon with Roar can phaze Extreme Killer in a pinch, and can also set up Stealth Rock for the team. On more offensive teams, Ditto is a good option to revenge kill a boosted Extreme Killer. Also, evaluate the effectiveness of using this over another Arceus set.

A Bold nature is used over Impish to minimize Foul Play and confusion damage. Leftovers is the primary item choice as Deoxys-D won't always have the time to use Recover, and the passive recovery can give it the extra turn it needs to get a Recover in. Rocky Helmet is an alternative, as it lets Deoxys-D punish the physical attackers that attempt to break through it, and the EV spread works well with it. Speaking of the EV spread, a Calm nature with an EV spread of 252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 Spe can be used to better handle special attacks from the likes of Latios, but many top special attackers like Greninja and Genesect catch Deoxys-D for super effective damage anyway. Thunder Wave and Toxic are two status moves Deoxys-D can use over Seismic Toss if you wish. Thunder Wave can cripple sweepers, while Toxic can make it easier for a teammate to break past a wall it would otherwise have trouble with."}, {"Content": "This Deoxys-D is best used on more defensive or stall-based teams, as it can take hits from a wide range of physical attackers while preventing most opposing defensive Pokemon from using recovery or supportive moves with a decently fast Taunt. Despite Deoxys-D's high Special Defense, don't attempt to leave it in on powerful special attackers unless you run the alternate EV spread. Despite the HP investment, Deoxys-D only tops out at 304 HP, so the likes of Latios, Greninja, and Genesect can still push past it with their powerful STAB moves. Be very careful around Tyranitar, Scizor, and Genesect. A well-timed Pursuit or U-turn from them will compromise Deoxys-D's defensive capabilities for later in the match, so don't be afraid of switching out if you feel like one of them is about to switch in. Always remember to use Deoxys-D's ability to check powerful threats, such as Azumarill and Talonflame, to set up entry hazards, rather than its Speed. Otherwise, you're better off using Deoxys-S."}, {"Content": "Since Deoxys-D has a hard time taking powerful special attacks from the likes of Latios, Greninja, and Genesect, having a teammate that can take these threats on is very helpful.

It can also use Heal Bell to rid Dexoys-D of any status it was unfortunate enough to be hit with. Tyranitar, Scizor, and Genesect are the biggest pains for Deoxys-D.

Taunt stops slower Defog and entry hazard users such as Skarmory, Togekiss, and Landorus-T. You can even use Taunt if you suspect that a faster Defog or entry hazard user, such as Latios or Garchomp, is about to switch in. Thunder Wave is the main move for the final slot. Along with Mental Herb, it allows Deoxys-D to cripple faster Taunt users and follow up with a Taunt of its own to safely set up entry hazards. Another countermeasure against faster Taunt users is Magic Coat. This can let Deoxys-D make any status move, such as Taunt, Stealth Rock, and Toxic, backfire against the Pokemon using it.

A Timid nature is used to get entry hazards up even faster. Mental Herb is the most sensible item to use as it lets Deoxys-D safely bypass faster Taunt users and hit them with its own Taunt. Red Card is a decent alternative that allows Deoxys-D to force out any threat that can't OHKO it. You can use a Tanga Berry to take less damage from Genesect's and Scizor's STAB U-turns. A Colbur Berry can be used to survive Crunch from Tyranitar, as well as a Knock Off from Bisharp. A Kasib Berry lets Deoxys-D stand up to Ghost-types such as Aegislash better. Another option is Rocky Helmet, which can wear down physical attackers that try to break through Deoxys-D. Finally, Leftovers can work to gain some passive recovery. However, keep in mind that these niche options only help against select threats and that Deoxys-D should aim to get entry hazards up as quickly as and efficiently as possible before going down. If Tyranitar is giving you fits, you can use Superpower. Be sure to use a Jolly nature if you decide to run Superpower so its power isn't lowered. At least 212 Attack EVs is needed with a Life Orb to ensure the KO.

Even if Deoxys-D is met with something that is probably going to KO it, you should leave it in. Remember, the goal of this set is to simply get up as many layers of entry hazards as possible before going down.

Lucario, Latios, and Talonflame are great examples of this. Greninja and Genesect are also notable due to their ability to use U-turn and to beat most users of Defog and Rapid Spin. Do note that Genesect will need a Choice Scarf to outspeed Latios, the fastest common user of Defog. A spinblocker to defeat Assault Vest Excadrill and Mega Blastoise is also a good choice. Trevenant and Nasty Plot + Trick Room Cofagrigus are solid options. Life Orb Aegislash can also be useful as it can Shadow Sneak Latios into oblivion before it gets a chance to use Defog, while very few other Pokemon can get in its way when hazards are on the field.

It allows Yveltal to break stall teams pretty efficiently and is a useful move to pair with Sucker Punch as it will force opponents to use an attack. Bolstered by Dark Aura, Dark Pulse is an extremely potent STAB option with few resists and great power: it easily 2HKOes 252 HP Arceus formes (assuming Arceus is not a type that resists Dark) and deals significant damage to most other Pokemon that attempt to switch in. Oblivion Wing is Yveltal's other primary STAB option; aside from demolishing Fighting-types and hitting Fairy-types neutrally, Oblivion Wing also allows Yveltal to sustain itself for an admirably long time by draining huge amounts of HP from its targets. Sucker Punch is generally the best move to round out the set as it provides Yveltal with a way to cleanly finish off faster switch-ins; for example, Dark Pulse followed by Sucker Punch is an easy 2HKO on Pokemon such as Palkia, Zekrom, and Kyogre.

Foul Play can be used to 2HKO Ho-Oh, who avoids the 2HKO from Dark Pulse due to its great Special Defense, and wreck boosting physical sweepers such as Swords Dance Arceus that might attempt to set up. Foul Play can also potentially be used over Dark Pulse as it still hits a lot of Pokemon for a 2HKO in conjunction with Sucker Punch, but be warned as without Dark Pulse Yveltal cannot threaten to 2HKO 252 HP Arceus. U-turn is also a decent option as it allows Yveltal to bait in and pivot out of defensive Fairy-types into a trapper such as Mega Gengar, leaving them helpless and Yveltal potentially free to wreak havoc later in the match.

Mild is generally preferred since Yveltal's resistances are predominantly for Special attacks, though Rash can also be used to better take hits from Mega Mewtwo X and physical Ghost Arceus sets. A Modest nature can also be run if not using Sucker Punch; in this case, shift the 4 EVs in Attack to Defense so as to not be wasteful.

This combination is resisted by Steel-type Pokemon, and Earthquake is the best option to deal with Heatran, Aegislash, and Mega Mawile. Fire Punch is an option to hit Skarmory and Ferrothorn with, but this Dragonite's relative lack of power compared to other sets means it fails to 2HKO them (Ferrothorn can avoid it with Leech Seed), so they are better off left to teammates to handle.

In fact, bulky Dragonite can actually survive a Life Orb Ice Beam from Protean Greninja with help from Multiscale. This of course means that this Dragonite can take some of the weaker Ice-type moves it encounters, such as Hidden Power Ice Thundurus and Icy Wind Keldeo, as well as powerful 2x effective attacks such as Life Orb Latios's Draco Meteor, and proceed to defeat these threats. This Dragonite's special bulk is not to be underestimated even if Multiscale is broken, as it can take two of Landorus's Sludge Waves, Aegislash's Shadow Balls, and Mega Charizard Y's sun-fueled Fire Blasts even after taking Stealth Rock damage, with only a very minuscule chance for Landorus's attack to net the 2HKO on the switch. These, as one might have noticed, are some of the most powerful neutral special attacks in the tier, and Dragonite can comfortably take them. With Multiscale intact, you can expect bulky Dragonite to withstand some physical abuse as well from physical attackers such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard X, Garchomp, and Bisharp."}, {"Content": "This Dragonite mostly aims to support its teammates rather than vice versa, as it is designed to withstand some of the most powerful special attacks in the tier. It would want Multiscale intact to function at its fullest capacity, so anti-hazard support is very much appreciated. Excadrill is not only the best candidate for Rapid Spin support, but can also provide Stealth Rock support while complementing Dragonite defensively. Dragonite can take on attackers such as Landorus, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard Y that threaten Excadrill, while Excadrill shields Dragonite from various Fairy-, Dragon-, and Rock-type moves. Heatran also has great synergy with Dragonite, with the two covering each other's weaknesses perfectly while still maintaining offensive presence. Bulky Dragonite dislikes status, as it heavily interferes with its tanking role, and even paralysis can interrupt its two-hit combo of Dragon Claw + Extreme Speed. Clerics such as Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Clefable can cure Dragonite of status and can even use Wish to restore Multiscale. Vaporeon also resists Ice-type attacks for Dragonite, while the Fairies can guard against Dragons in case Dragonite gets caught out against them without its Multiscale active. Offensive teams like Dragonite's ability to tank without losing much offensive momentum, so naturally its best partners are sweepers that have weaknesses to types that Dragonite resists, especially Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Mawile, Excadrill, and Mega Scizor.

Fire Punch hits the remaining non-Ground-weak Steel-types, such as Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn, extremely hard.

Choice Outrage isn't so bad when you consider that a direct switch-in with a Fairy-type will not lock Dragonite in; only after Dragonite has pounded something's face in can it not switch.

Extreme Speed is one of Dragonite's unique traits and main selling points, outspeeding priority users such as Mamoswine, Thundurus, and Talonflame thanks to its +2 priority, as well as Choice Scarf users that intend to circumvent Dragonite's Speed boost, though it requires its targets to be weakened in order to achieve KOs.

Alternatively, Dragonite may opt for Weakness Policy, which takes a slightly different but very effective approach towards its EV placement. 24 EVs go into Defense, which seems relatively insignificant but always allows Dragonite to survive Play Rough from Choice Band Azumarill, provided Multiscale is active, adding a Weakness Policy setup target to the list. The remaining 232 Speed EVs are just enough to outrun Timid Noivern after a Dragon Dance, the fastest threat Dragonite would like to outspeed naturally, as faster threats can and should be hit with Extreme Speed. It should also be noted that Weakness Policy Dragonite should run Dragon Claw as its STAB move, since Weakness Policy can make up for the lower power, and Dragon Claw does not lock Dragonite in, which can blow the one-time Weakness Policy sweep. Lum Berry is generally more useful since it allows Dragonite to set up on status users such as Rotom-W, weakened Thundurus, and Gliscor, and it also snaps Dragonite out of Outrage confusion.

Alternatively, it can set up early to punch holes into the opponent's team so that its teammates can finish off their weakened checks and counters. Dragonite can find setup opportunities against Heatran, Keldeo, Mega Venusaur, and various Choice-locked attacks that do not threaten it, especially with Multiscale taken into account. Lum Berry Dragonite can set up safely on walls that have little offensive power and rely on status for their form of damage, such as Chansey and Rotom-W. It also can save its Lum Berry to allow for longer sweeps using Outrage without interference from confusion. Weakness Policy Dragonite can occasionally afford to switch into a super effective hit, though that would deny it the opportunity to boost its Speed, as it usually takes advantage of weaker attackers with a super effective move to discourage their attack and keep its Multiscale intact. Once Dragonite is in, the opponent has two choices: hit Dragonite with a super effective move which activates Dragonite's Weakness Policy, letting it net +3 Attack and +1 Speed in one fell swoop; or use a weaker move to avoid triggering Weakness Policy and leave Dragonite practically unscathed.

Greninja not only has access to U-turn to do this, but can further support Dragonite with Spikes, while Rotom-W and Scizor easily lure in Grass-types and Fire-types, respectively. Weakness Policy Dragonite requires a bit more support, as it would like to face off against Fairy-, Rock- and Dragon-types. Conkeldurr easily lures in Fairy-types, Talonflame draws in Rock-types, and Keldeo brings Latios and Latias in. U-turn would make this easier for Dragonite, and U-turn Mandibuzz, Talonflame, or Noivern and Volt Switch Rotom-W can all help Dragonite face off against its desired opponents. Regardless of Dragonite's coverage move of choice, Magnezone makes a great partner due to its ability to handle problematic Steel- and Fairy-types, with the two also covering each other's weaknesses nicely; Magnezone can also lure in Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-types, the former two of which Magnezone can Volt Switch away from to bring Dragonite in unharmed."}, {"Content": "Since Multiscale is a big factor to Dragonite's success, a Rapid Spinner or Defogger makes a welcome teammate.

Wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Aegislash are useful for softening foes for Dragonite to clean up, and Mega Charizard Y even has Drought to prevent sandstorm from breaking Dragonite's Multiscale.

Use Volt Switch to gain momentum when you know Thunderbolt won't KO a switch-in even after factoring in the boost from Analytic. This allows you to switch to the appropriate check to what they send in, keeping the momentum of the battle in your favor.

However, if Tornadus-T isn't being used in conjunction with Politoed or manual Rain Dance, Air Slash can be used for a reliable Flying-type STAB. Superpower completes Tornadus-T's coverage, beating common Flying-type resists such as Heatran or Tyranitar, while also hitting common specially defensive walls such as Blissey hard. Knock Off allows Tornadus-T to neuter special walls such as Jirachi or Blissey by removing Leftovers, allowing them to be worn down easier through the course of the match. Tornadus-T also serves as one of the best Knock Off users, threatening nearly every Mega Evolution that would commonly switch into the move. Focus Blast can be used to give Tornadus-T a more powerful attack; while it does worse against common special walls, it generally gets more damage against the rest of the metagame. U-turn allows Tornadus-T to make full use of Regenerator and deal valuable chip damage. Rain Dance can be used over Knock Off if Tornadus-T is not paired with Politoed and still wishes to use Hurricane. However, it is important to note that Tornadus-T has a much harder time sweeping without Knock Off as it hits otherwise hard counters such as Jirachi and Aegislash while also being able to remove passive healing from special walls."}, {"Content": "If Tornadus-T is used outside of rain, Heat Wave can be used in order to reliably take down Scizor, Genesect, and Ferrothorn. Taunt can also be used, preventing entry hazard leads as well as special walls from healing themselves."}, {"Content": "The EVs are focused on maximizing Tornadus-T's Special Attack and Speed stats, allowing it to hit as hard as possible while maintaining its crucial Speed tier. A Life Orb is used to increase Tornadus-T's damage output, with Regenerator healing the Life Orb damage. An Assault Vest can be used instead of Life Orb in order to bolster Tornadus-T's Special Defense. This, when paired with U-turn and Regenerator, makes Tornadus-T less of a powerful wallbreaker and more of a bulky pivot."}, {"Content": "When using Tornadus-T, you always need to be cognizant of how many turns of Drizzle are left. If Tornadus-T is weakened, U-turn + Regenerator is not only a great way to gain momentum, but also a great way to slowly heal Tornadus-T back to full health. Early in the match, it is often best to start by using Knock Off, as this allows Tornadus-T to neuter its checks' passive healing, meaning after a few more confrontations where Tornadus-T U-turns on them, they should be within KO range. This strategy will only work if Tornadus-T is paired with partners which can threaten common checks to it, preventing said checks from healing the U-turn chip damage."}, {"Content": "If Hurricane is used, Politoed is an almost mandatory partner, giving the attack 100% accuracy. Tornadus-T pairs well with other momentum move users, allowing it many chances to switch in; Genesect and Rotom-W are thus excellent partners.

Once again, Forretress is a team supporter, so the set you choose should be based around what suits your team best."}, {"Content": "Dedicated spinblockers are less common is Ubers due to Defog being the most used method of removing hazards but should your opponent carry a spinblocker while you have hazards up, Volt Switching is generally the correct and safest play although poisoning an Arceus-Ghost or Giratina-O switchin will make them much easier to handle. Forretress can actually set up Spikes after poisoning a Giratina-O and force it to take more Toxic damage as it stays in to Defog. Spikes should be used when your opponent is going to switch or after Forretress has poisoned a support Arceus that can't touch it, like Arceus-Grass. When an opponent is going to switch, make sure to note how threatening Forretress's switch-in is. If it can be handled easily, thenbegin to set up Spikes, but if your team is greatly threatened by it, then Volt Switching into something that can check it will be your best course of action.

Forretress also loves receiving Wishes from Wish passers such as Sylveon, Blissey, and Chansey. Tyranitar, Arceus-Rock, and Arceus-Water all have amazing type synergy with Forretress and the former helps Forry stack on residual damage with sandstorm.

Lugia loves having Stealth Rock off its side of the field whilst having Spikes on the opponents side in order to have its phazing shenanigans pack some punch. Ho-Oh adores a Stealth Rock free field and can shrug off any Fire move aimed at Forretress. Fairies can use two of Forretress's most dangerous switch-ins, Palkia and Yveltal, as set-up bait. Forretress generally does better on offensively inclined teams that are able to apply enough pressure to Defoggers and Rapid Spinners to keep them off the field, or punish a turn of clearing the field with a sweep.

Recover is mandatory to heal off the damage from the opponents it walls; without it, Quagsire would not be able to effectively take foes on. Finally, Toxic is a great move to cripple walls and other defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Clefable, and Trevenant.

Scald is the move that should be used the most often, unless the opponent has a way of dealing with it, such as Water Absorb or Storm Drain, in which case Toxic is the most optimal choice. Against a Natural Cure user, your best bet is to switch into something which can deal with it. Remember, Quagsire absolutely hates status, so if you predict that the opponent will use a status move such as Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, don't hesitate to switch out.

Gyarados utilizes its great typing, natural bulk, and Intimidate to set up multiple Dragon Dances and then attempt to sweep. Taunt and Substitute are the two possible moves of choice to help Gyarados set up Dragon Dances or sweep easier. Taunt does an excellent job of shutting down recovery and stopping moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Toxic from hampering Gyarados's sweep, while also preventing Roar and Whirlwind from forcing Gyarados out. Specifically, Taunt is great for threats such as Skarmory, Gliscor, Trevenant, and Gourgeist as the majority of their moveset is dependent on support moves such as Substitute, Roost, Whirlwind, and Will-O-Wisp. Substitute functions by preventing status from hampering Gyarados, blocking weak attacks to ease setting up Dragon Dance, obtaining extra recovery from Leftovers, and preventing Gyarados from being easy to revenge kill. Bounce is Gyarados's best option for its attack. Bounce allows Gyarados to bypass its biggest counters - Mega Venusaur and Celebi - while the charge-up turn allows Gyarados to obtain extra health from Leftovers and protect its Substitute. Taunt and Bounce are great together because Taunt completely shuts down the opponent's attempts at blocking Bounce through Substitute or Protect."}, {"Content": "Though Bounce is superior in most scenarios, Earthquake can be used to bypas any King's Shield mind games from Aegislash. Stone Edge is also an option to beat opposing Gyarados, Kyurem-B, and Rotom-W more easily."}, {"Content": "The given EVs allow +1 Speed Gyarados to outspeed Timid Noivern. Furthermore, the HP and Defense EVs allow Gyarados to a burned Ferrothorn's Power Whip while behind a Substitute. It also prevents many Water-types such as Slowbro without Psyshock from breaking through Gyarados's Substitutes. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to help Gyarados's attacks hit reasonably hard after a single Dragon Dance. With Stealth Rock, a +1 Bounce can OHKO Calm Mega Venusaur, offensive Celebi, and max HP Conkeldurr. Gyarados can opt to go slower in exchange for extra power. After a Dragon Dance, 176 Speed EVs guarentee that Gyarados will outspeed Timid Starmie."}, {"Content": "Bulky Dragon Dance Gyarados is a very flexible Pokemon due to its both offensive and defensive prowess. The choice between Substitute and Taunt is very crucial to knowing how to succeed with Gyarados setting up Dragon Dance. Taunt means running a few more risks with Dragon Tail, Scald, and Lava Plume; however, Substitute is still vulnerable to Roar, Whirlwind, and having Bounce blocked by Protect, Substitute, and King's Shield. Gyarados can switch into a variety of offensive and defensive Pokemon and begin setting up. With Taunt, Gyarados can switch into an opposing Skarmory and Taunt it to prevent it from using Whirlwind and Roost. Thanks to Intimidate and Gyarados's defensive EV spread, Brave Bird is a possible 5HKO, while Skarmory will continue to take recoil damage, making a 2HKO from a boosted Waterfall easier. Substitute is great against Pokemon such as Gastrodon that rely on status to cripple its opponents, letting Gyarados continuously set up Dragon Dance. Best of all, Substitute can make Gyarados more difficult to revenge kill."}, {"Content": "This variation of Gyarados works exceptionally well on balanced teams that combine offensive and defensive Pokemon. Mega Venusaur is a great defensive Grass-types that can harass a lot of Gyarados's checks and counters with its great defenses and solid movepool. It can use its STAB Sludge Bomb to hit Unaware Clefable, while STAB Giga Drain eliminates Rotom-W. Hidden Power Fire further helps ease the the burden on Gyarados by defeating Ferrothorn.. Ferrothorn resists many of Gyarados's weaknesses while being able utilize its kit to help Gyarados remain bulky with Leech Seed, ensure KOes with Stealth Rock, or slow down opponents with Thunder Wave. Water-types with Scald or Will-O-Wisp are great for luring in Ferrothorn to help Gyarados set up on those that rely on Power Whip. Rotom-W and Slowbro are great examples. Trevenant and Gourgeist are great examples of Pokemon that can use Will-O-Wisp and/or Leech Seed to aid Gyarados. Starmie can spin away Stealth Rock while handling Skarmory and Mega Venusaur with Thunderbolt and STAB Psyshock, respectively. Scald also can be used on Starmie to be used as a lure for Ferrothorn. Latias, Scizor, and Zapdos are great users of Defog. Scizor and Zapdos can use their STAB U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively, to pivot to Gyarados to help it set up. Latios is an offensive alternative to Latias for using Defog as it can leave dents in or KO various Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory.

It is likely Blaziken will use Protect first on that turn, allowing you to act accordingly. Gyarados can use its type change for a free Dragon Dance as Mega Gyarados.

Mega Gyarados can survive Thunders if it has full health, so use that chance to grab another boost if you desperately need it. Not even Life Orb Mewtwo's Aura Sphere can OHKO minimal bulk Mega Gyarados after Stealth Rock damage. A +2 Earthquake OHKOes Kyogre and Palkia after Stealth Rock damage, so you can grab another boost as they come in to try and Thunder you if you're feeling ballsy. Simply spamming attacks from the start can be great to weaken down foes such as Groudon. Support Groudon can't really destroy Gyarados quickly, so wear it down first before attempting a sweep. Rain boosts Gyarados's power, and is greatly appreciated but not necessary because Kyogre shares some unfortunate weaknesses with Gyarados. Mega Gyarados is one of the bulkiest sweepers, so use that to your advantage. It can tank hits such as Dialga's Draco Meteor and KO back with a boosted Earthquake. Mega Gyarados is immune to Psytrike so you can play around Mewtwo. Even if the opponent predicts well and uses Aura Sphere, Mega Gyarados can survive and take out Mewtwo with a boosted Bite or Waterfall. Iron Head is your best move against Xerneas but does not provide much coverage.

Another great example is stalling out Gyarados's Mega Evolution to lure in Rotom-W and then immediately Mega-Evolve to shut it down with a Mold Breaker Earthquake. Mega Gyarados has awesome bulk and can take emergency attacks at full health. When utilizing Moxie, Gyarados should be held back and used later in the game or when the opponent has a significant number of Pokemon to use as death fodder. Moxie should be stacked up as much as Gyarados possibly can before Mega Evolving as it will lose Moxie for Mold Breaker. The chosen coverage move is crucial to determining what Gyarados will need eliminated before it can attempt to sweep. Remember that Mega Gyarados's number one counter is Ferrothorn.

Ferrothorn is a good teammate as it can lay down Stealth Rock to help Gyarados when it's phazing, spread paralysis to completely cripple offensive threats, and use Leech Seed to help Gyarados passively recover on some targets. Rapid Spin from Starmie works well at eliminating potential offensive threats and some defensive targets. Since Dragon Tail can be a liability against Fairy-types, Excadrill can be used to KO them with its STAB Iron Head while spinning away entry hazards. Mega Venusaur is also a great teammate because Gyarados's Intimidate can help it tank otherwise dangerous threats such as other Gyarados, Rotom-W, and Azumarill.

Roar prevents Vaporeon from being phazed out, and can be especially useful if Vaporeon has been passed speed boosts, as this will allow Vaporeon's Roar to go before the opponent's Roar or Whirlwind. Wish is Vaporeon's main niche in the standard set, and can be very useful in a Baton Passs set as well, reliably healing teammates who cannot heal themselves. Vaporeon's natural bulk makes it incredibly effective at increasing the chain's defense with Acid Armor, and makes its Substitutes harder to break. Aqua Ring can be used to grant the entire chain permanent extra recovery, and is the equivalent of a free Leftovers. Wish can be used to recover HP somewhat reliably and create more Substitutes if necessary, but if you're taking that much damage it's probably better to switch to a Pokemon more suitable to handle the threat. As with many Baton Pass chain Pokemon, the moves you run on Vaporeon should be suited to the team's needs.

The remaining EVs are put into its weaker physical defense stat to maximize the defensive boosts and keep Vaporeon as bulky as possible. For the same reason, a Bold nature is also used to improve physical defense. Leftovers are the obvious choice for an item, and help Vaporeon make as many Substitutes as possible."}, {"Content": "Substitute is something that needs to be kept up at all times as the chain is setting up to prevent status and guard against critical hits, and Vaporeon can make the largest Substitutes of any Pokemon that has access to Baton Pass.

The last thing you want is to lose all of the boosts you have accumulated because a random critical hit broke through something. Roar + Whirlwind users are usually predictable, if your opponent sends in something like Skarmory always Roar immediately even if it means eating a Brave Bird or giving up a layer of Spikes.

Mr. Mime with Soundproof and Encore can form a Baton Passing duo with Vaporeon that can effectively neutralize any Pokemon trying to set up alongside the chain. Vaporeon can follow Scizor in a chain as it appreciates the Iron Defense that Scizor passes, and Scizor draws the Fire-type moves that Vaporeon can set up on.

In order to do this efficiently, Froslass needs to use Taunt to prevent opposing Pokemon from using Defog or Taunt, setting up their own entry hazards, or setting up. Destiny Bond is also effective in tandem with Froslass's base 110 Speed and allows her to take down other Pokemon, especially Rapid Spin users, with her after Focus Sash is used up. Thunder Wave is preferred for the last move of the set because it allows her to shut down fast Pokemon trying to set up, such as Mega Houndoom, and paves the way for her own Taunt and Destiny Bond. Icy Wind is a STAB option that works similar to Thunder Wave and keeps Froslass from becoming complete Taunt bait.

If instead they just have an all-out attacker, then start setting up Spikes. When Froslass is about to be KOed, a choice must be made. If you feel that you have enough layers of Spikes up and the attacking Pokemon is a threat to your team, then use Destiny Bond. If the Pokemon is not a threat, then an extra layer of Spikes may be more helpful. Be careful, as a savvy opponent might know about Destiny Bond, expect it, and not attack the second time.

Not only are there few defensive Pokemon that resist the Dark-type, but almost all of them lose their item when struck with Knock Off, rendering them much easier to beat. Crabhammer's power is also incredibly impressive; achieving a 2HKO on max HP Azumarill with a resisted move is something else. Aqua Jet is weaker, but it gives Crawdaunt some utility against faster teams, letting it force out important and frail members of the opposing team, creating opportunities to throw around Crabhammer or Knock Off. Beyond pressuring frail Pokemon, Aqua Jet provides revenge killing utility against dangerous threats such as a weakened Mega Tyranitar. While Crunch appears completely redundant with Knock Off, its superior power against Mega Pokemon allows Crawdaunt to break past the bulkiest ones, such as Venusaur. Swords Dance on such a slow and frail Pokemon is understandably questionable, but it makes Crawdaunt an even more fearsome stallbreaker. It will only be successful if applied carefully against opponents, but when it is successful it bursts open the proverbial dam of defenses for other team members to capitalize on. Aerial Ace can be run for the sole purpose of sniping Chesnaught, but has little use otherwise. Finally, Superpower can be run in the final slot. Though situational, it lets Crawdaunt easily destroy Mega Gyarados, which walls it otherwise."}, {"Content": "Adaptability's power increase makes it by far the most useful ability Crawdaunt has. The EV spread is simple and optimal. Maximum Attack with an Adamant nature hits as hard as possible, letting Crawdaunt excel as a wallbreaker. Maximum Speed with a neutral nature outspeeds up to uninvested base 86 Speed Pokemon, while Jolly can be used to get the drop on Jolly Mawile, Azumarill, and slightly invested Rotom-W. Choice Band confers an insane amount of power to Crawdaunt, letting it easily 2HKO even bulky Pokemon that resist its STAB. A Life Orb is also perfect for Crawdaunt, allowing it to switch moves, letting it finish off switch-ins sufficiently weakened by Knock Off or Crabhammer. A Life Orb is the only appropriate item to use with Swords Dance."}, {"Content": "Crawdaunt's defenses are bad, so simply bringing it on resisted moves is not a sufficiently safe tactic; only weak resisted moves can be comfortably absorbed and even they might be unsafe as generally they have a nasty side effect, such as Heatran's Lava Plume or Mandibuzz's Knock Off. In general, careful double switches, clean switch-ins, or switch advantage generated by U-turn or Volt Switch users are the best time to bring Crawdaunt in. Crawdaunt outspeeds most defensive Pokemon and OHKOes many, so simply select powerful STABs against them and watch as massive damage is dealt. Against offensive teams, Crawdaunt's application is a bit more complex. If it can not outspeed the opposition and OHKO, it will be lost. Therefore, only Aqua Jet-weak threats such as Landorus or Terrakion as well as slower threats whose priority Crawdaunt resists, such as a weakened Mega Mawile, should be checked with Crawdaunt. After that, it is necessary to read the play and predict correctly, as hitting an incoming Water-type resistance with Aqua Jet is useless, but hitting that same opponent with Knock Off will most certainly sting. Try to appraise how important what you threaten with Crawdaunt is and then predict accordingly. Crawdaunt is a wallbreaker first, so it should be played very aggressively against stall teams, and if the opportunity to break through the opponent's defensive core comes such that a win condition is in sight, don't be afraid to let Crawdaunt go down in the process. Swords Dance is challenging to use and will only really be successful against heavily defensive teams that try to utilize recovery + Toxic, recovery + Rocky Helmet, or Leech Seed + Protect to stall out Crawdaunt. Should the opponent attempt these kinds of tactics, simply set up in their face and they will have a real problem on their hands. Do not be afraid of Unaware users as both are easily 2HKOed with the correct STAB. Crawdaunt is not hard to check for faster teams unless its Aqua Jet will be needed later in the match, so after scoring a KO it is better to just let Crawdaunt get KOed than to switch it out and take heavy damage or give free setup as Crawdaunt's main job is to fight defensive teams."}, {"Content": "Though Crawdaunt is powerful, a few switch-ins such as Keldeo and Chesnaught do exist; good answers to these Pokemon are useful to have alongside Crawdaunt. Mega Venusaur with Hidden Power Fire is a solid answer to all of these threats, and with its Leech Seed immunity it makes Chesnaught easier to wear down.

Soft-Boiled gives Chansey a reliable means of recovery, allowing her to stay healthy throughout the match. Heal Bell is the move of choice for the second slot, as it allows Chansey to heal crippling status effects on her teammates. Stealth Rock is another option that Chansey can use if none of her other teammates are able to use the move. However, it is worth noting that losing the ability to use Heal Bell means that Chansey can no longer heal status effects for her teammates. Toxic is chosen for the third slot due to its ability to put both setup sweepers and walls on a timer. Thunder Wave is another option that Chansey has access to. Though it immediately shuts down faster boosting sweepers, it also leaves Chansey unable to gets past other, bulkier Pokemon. Stealth Rock is once again an option in the third slot, but it must be noted that Chansey is especially vulnerable to setup sweepers if it decides to go without status, especially those with recovery. Finally, Seismic Toss is the move of choice in the last spot due to its ability to deal reliable damage to the opponent."}, {"Content": "Eviolite is the most important part of this set, as it changes Chansey from an outclassed NFE to the special wall that she is. Due to her large HP stat, Chansey doesn't need to invest in HP. This makes a spread of max Defense and Special Defense the most optimal, as it boosts both her defensive stats to great levels. A Bold nature further boosts Chansey's physical bulk, allowing her to take physical hits surprisingly well. Finally, Natural Cure benefits Chansey by allowing her to recover from status moves as she switches out, making her almost impossible to wear down with Toxic."}, {"Content": "Due to her good bulk, Chansey can be used to check and/or counter the following Pokemon: Goodra, Greninja, Heatran, Kingdra, Latias, (Mega) Alakazam, (Mega) Gardevoir, Mega Manetric, (Mega) Venusaur, non-Knock Off Deoxys-S, non-Knock Off Landorus, non-Knock Off Thundurus, non-Trick Rotom-W, Politoed, Raikou, special Mega Charizard-Y, Starmie, Substitute Kyurem-B, Togekiss, Unaware Clefable, Volcarona, Zapdos, and plenty more. One of the most important things to note when using Chansey is to keep it healthy at all times; without Leftovers, it can have a really easy time getting worn down. Some users of setup moves can have a really easy time boosting against Chansey, so make sure to switch out, use status, or hit them with Seismic Toss if you expect a boosting move. Scouting for Knock Off and Trick against more uncommon users of the move such as Landorus, Thundurus, and Rotom-W is very important in order to keep your Eviolite. Heal Bell, while useful, can also cause your team to lose momentum. As such, only use it when one of your teammates absolutely needs its status ailments cured."}, {"Content": "Chansey has many different Pokemon that can pair with it effectively. Unaware users, such as Quagsire and Clefable, are the most helpful partners, as they can stop Pokemon that commonly like to set up against Chansey. Physical walls, such as Hippowdon and physically defensive Mega Venusaur, can help absorb physical moves for Chansey.

Thus, Swords Dance is a necessity for Mega Pinsir, and it works very well with Quick Attack. After the Aerilate boost, Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack hits roughly 78 Base Power, and after a Sword Dance, it can be used to take out most of the Pokemon that would be able to revenge kill it. Return is an incredibly powerful STAB attack for Mega Pinsir that has no drawbacks. Finally, Earthquake is used to take on the Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-type Pokemon that could otherwise take a hit from Mega Pinsir. Most notably, Earthquake is able to OHKO Aegislash in its Shield forme at +2."}, {"Content": "Pinsir should never be used seriously in OU without its Mega Evolution, so Pinsirite is the obvious choice for an item. EVs are standard for a physical sweeper, though an Adamant nature can used instead of Jolly in order to OHKO standard Gliscor at +2 with Return and Latias at +2 with Quick Attack. Hyper Cutter is the most reliable choice for an ability on Pinsir in its regular forme, as it keeps Intimidate users such as Landorus-T from lowering its Attack on the switch. Moxie is another viable choice to pick off a weakened foe before Mega Evolving in order to receive an Attack boost."}, {"Content": "Pinsir should usually only come into battle later into the game after most of its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened or knocked out. Still, it might be advantageous to bring it in earlier on into the match in order to Mega Evolve and pick off a weakened opponent with Quick Attack. Because its base forme only has base 85 Speed, it's best to Mega Evolve against something it can set up on or something that it can revenge kill with its Quick Attack. Mega Evolving is usually only difficult against more offensive teams that can keep up offensive pressure. Against more defensive teams, you can Mega Evolve earlier on in hopes of wallbreaking with Mega Pinsir. Thanks to its good physical bulk, Mega Pinsir can often set up against physical attackers that do not carry a super effective coverage move, including Breloom without Rock Tomb and Landorus-T without Rock Slide or Stone Edge. However, it's usually going to be easier to set up on a forced switch."}, {"Content": "Some of Mega Pinsir's best counters are things that can lure in its checks and counters. A good example of this is Choice Band Talonflame, which can soften up Rotom-W and allow Mega Pinsir to KO it easily later. Another good partner for this reason is Assault Vest Conkeldurr, which can easily switch into Rotom-Wash and Air Balloon Heatran, as it benefits from being burned and takes little from their attacks, and can threaten them with its Fighting STAB in return. A Rapid Spin or Defog user is another necessary partner for Mega Pinsir, as it relies a lot on its bulk in order to tank faster priority attacks and neutral hits while it sets up. Excadrill is a good parter, as it can use Rapid Spin and deal massive damage to Rotom-Wash with its Mold Breaker Earthquake, and Life Orb Latias can use Defog and Healing Wish to support Mega Pinsir, while also offering a good switch into Rotom-Wash, Thundurus, and Zapdos.

The rest of the moves are there solely for the purpose of removing Pokemon that can absorb Moonblast. A Life Orb-boosted Rock Slide OHKOes Ho-Oh even without Stealth Rock, but aside from that, it doesn't really do much. Thunder is inaccurate, but it hits most Steel-types neutrally, OHKOes Ho-Oh if Stealth Rock is up, and OHKOes offensive Kyogre after it has switched into Stealth Rock twice. Close Combat also hits Steel-types, OHKOes Blissey, and 2HKOes Chansey, but it's not as strong as Focus Blast against most targets. In fact, the only reason Close Combat should be used over Focus Blast is if your team struggles against Blissey and Chansey, as they are the only targets hit harder by Close Combat. Night Slash rounds out the set because it is Xerneas's strongest move against Aegislash. Night Slash is the only move that Xerneas can use to reliably waltz around Aegislash, but it is vulnerable to King's Shield and only 3HKOes Aegislash at best. Xerneas can run specific moves to help beat down certain walls that it may come up against. Grass Knot OHKOes support Rock Arceus and Water Arceus while hitting Kyogre hard. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Scizor and Ferrothorn while 2HKOing Aegislash and Bronzong under sun. Aromatherapy is also an option on this set, and though it doesn't deal damage, Xerneas can use it to relieve a desperate team of crippling status conditions. As another bonus, Xerneas's offensive presence helps it score free turns to use Aromatherapy, something no other cleric can boast."}, {"Content": "Life Orb provides a large boost to all of Xerneas's moves, but its recoil might make it undesirable on certain teams. Pixie Plate and Expert Belt are both viable alternatives to Life Orb, and they both allow Xerneas to bluff other sets, while Life Orb cannot. The boosts the two items provide, however, are smaller and less consistent than Life Orb. If Expert Belt is run, a spread of 140 Atk / 184 SpA / 184 Spe is recommended, as it allows Xerneas to 2HKO Chansey with Close Combat 100% of the time and outspeed base 90s."}, {"Content": "Xerneas can shift EVs from Speed into Attack to hit harder with its physical attacks. A spread of 70 Atk / 252 SpA / 184 Spe gives up Xerneas's ability to Speed tie with Yveltal and Genesect in exchange for a slightly more powerful Close Combat and Rock Slide. When boosted by Expert Belt, Rock Slide has a decent chance to OHKO offensive Ho-Oh, and when boosted by Life Orb, bears a higher chance to OHKO 252 HP Ho-Oh."}, {"Content": "Xerneas generally runs a Mild nature, which reduces its Defense, as the unreduced Special Defense stat helps it better absorb a Dark Pulse or Oblivion Wing from Yveltal. However, a Rash nature can be run if an unhindered Defense stat is required by its team.

As such, it should not try to sweep unless the Pokemon on the other team are all slower than Xerneas. A teammate should try to capitalize from the holes Xerneas creates in the opposing team in order to sweep."}, {"Content": "Xerneas's bulk is reduced by its nature, so it should be very careful when switching in as to conserve its HP. However, at the same time, Xerneas should be switched in as often as possible to wear down enemy walls such as Aegislash. Xerneas should not be afraid to reveal that it has Night Slash, as the move can 3HKO Aegislash, but if Xerneas is holding an Expert Belt or a Pixie Plate, hiding Night Slash might be worth it. Due to its item, it can bluff a Choice Scarf set very well, and as such can help it secure additional KOs. For example, pretending that Xerneas is locked into Moonblast can be very useful for luring Ho-Oh out and OHKOing it with Rock Slide. The main idea of this set is to wreck walls and weaken Pokemon that can take a Moonblast in order to spam it later on. Therefore, if the opposing team has few Pokemon that can tank Moonblast, Moonblast should be spammed as often as possible."}, {"Content": "If the Xerneas user can correctly predict when Aegislash will switch in, then Xerneas can defeat it. However, since such prediction is difficult, Pokemon that can wear down Xerneas's counters for it are appreciated. Scizor is one of the best partners for Xerneas, as it is capable of trapping and killing Aegislash with the combination of Swords Dance and Pursuit. It can prevent Xerneas from losing momentum, and can act as a sweeper that takes advantage of the holes Xerneas busts in opposing teams. Mega Gengar can function similarly to Scizor, trapping Lugia and defeating it with Taunt and Shadow Ball. Life Orb Yveltal is like Mega Gengar in that it can easily defeat Xerneas's counters, but it cannot trap them. However, Yveltal gets U-turn, which can be used to grant Xerneas opportunities to switch in. In general, Pokemon that can provide offensive pressure are useful because they can keep Pokemon that wall Xerneas at bay. They can also provide momentum and help get Xerneas into play. Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock are beneficial for Xerneas too, as Stealth Rock will damage Pokemon when Xerneas forces switches. Furthermore, Stealth Rock allows Xerneas to OHKO Ho-Oh with Thunder, and breaks Multiscale, preventing Lugia from absorbing Moonblast comfortably."}, {"Content": "The fact that most of Xerneas's counters are rather weak and have difficulty stopping other sweepers is particularly noteworthy. Combine this with Xerneas's ability to defeat walls on the opposing team, and it seems almost mandatory that Xerneas should be paired with a sweeper.

Additionally, Zekrom can set up a Tailwind and use Volt Switch on most of Xerneas's counters; greatly aiding Xerneas in tormenting the other team.

Moonblast is Xerneas's strongest STAB move and hits ridiculously hard after a boost. A boosted Thunder OHKOes Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock and hits most Steel-types, namely Bronzong, Aegislash, and Heatran, for neutral damage. Psyshock is also viable as it hits Poison-types, especially Amoonguss, very hard and can also OHKO Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock. Xerneas can use Substitute on this set much better than it can on the Geomancy set due to Leftovers and the fact that its Substitutes can tank a Seismic Toss from Chansey. Substitute provides Xerneas with protection from Thundurus-I and Chansey's status moves and allows it to play mind games with Aegislash. Aegislash cannot use Toxic on Xerneas due to Substitute, so it will be forced to use Gyro Ball. In response, Xerneas can either use Substitute as Aegislash uses King's Shield or predict a second Gyro Ball and OHKO with Thunder. Focus Blast hits Steel-types super effectively and lets Xerneas smash huge holes in enemy Heatran and Ferrothorn, whereas Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Ferrothorn and 2HKOes Aegislash in the sun after a Calm Mind boost."}, {"Content": "Leftovers increases Xerneas's longevity and helps it make an extra Substitute, but other items such as Life Orb can be used too. Life Orb boosts the power of Xerneas's attacks, and after a Calm Mind, Life Orb Xerneas is about as powerful its Geomancy counterpart. The EV spread invests enough in HP for Xerneas to make Substitutes that can tank a Seismic Toss from Chansey, and allows Xerneas to survive a boosted Extreme Speed from Silk Scarf Extreme Killer Arceus. The EVs in Speed are enough for it to outspeed all neutral-natured Rayquaza, Kyurem-W, and Kyurem-B, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack to give Xerneas more power. If the team Xerneas is on can handle Chansey, then a Life Orb and a spread that maximizes Special Attack and Speed can be used. A Bold nature and a spread that maximizes HP and Defense is also viable to make Xerneas a bulky sweeper. Thanks to all the investment in its bulk, Xerneas is only 4HKOed by Aegislash's Gyro Ball. If such a spread is used, then Rest can be run in tandem with a Chesto Berry or Sleep Talk to restore Xerneas's HP. This Xerneas runs a Modest nature for the extra power, but if it is desired, a Timid nature can be used so that Xerneas will always outspeed Rayquaza, Kyurem-W, and Kyurem-B. Additionally, it will allow Xerneas to Speed tie with max Speed Yveltal and Xerneas, but it is generally inferior to a Modest nature due to the decrease in Xerneas's power and the boost it gives to an opposing Aegislash or Bronzong's Gyro Ball."}, {"Content": "Unlike with Geomancy, Xerneas can set up with Calm Mind after it has been forced out.

Xerneas should try to lure out and hit its counters as hard as it can and set up with Calm Mind to land the final blow. It should start sweeping only when it's sure it can beat its counters with a Calm Mind boost. It's best for Xerneas to set up a Calm Mind on a Pokemon that it can force out or has trouble breaking its Substitute. Alternatively, Calm Mind Xerneas can feign a defensive set, which it will appear to be running when Leftovers are shown, and then lure in Pokemon it can set up on."}, {"Content": "Because this Xerneas cannot boost its Speed, it has issues with revenge killers and Mega Gengar, so one should try to lure them out and kill them quickly.

Megahorn OHKOes Mega Mewtwo Y and Focus Blast deals heavy damage to Steel-types that resist Moonblast, namely Heatran and Ferrothorn. Close Combat deals less damage to most Steel-types, but it 2HKOes Blissey. Rock Slide allows Xerneas to lure in and deal very heavy damage to Ho-Oh, which otherwise walls Xerneas.

A spread that maximizes Special Attack and Speed is viable if Xerneas is focused on sweeping late-game with Moonblast, but only if the team already has a check to Mega Mewtwo Y. The greater Speed also helps against opposing Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal. The EVs invested in Attack can be shifted from Special Attack instead of Speed, but doing so may make it harder for Xerneas to sweep, it might fail to KO certain Pokemon. A Rash nature is used over a Mild nature because decreasing Xerneas's defense will lead to an OHKO from a boosted Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed or a Life Orb Ho-Oh's Brave Bird. However, decreasing Xerneas's Special Defense does not turn any 2HKOs into OHKOs. A Mild nature is not unviable though, as when Xerneas switches into Yveltal to check it, the nature will decrease the damage taken from Oblivion Wing.

However, using Substitute is not always recommended, as it will significantly impair Xerneas's coverage. Hidden Power Fire hits Aegislash super effectively and reliably OHKOes Scizor and Ferrothorn, but does not do much else.

Reallocating the HP EVs into Defense is an option to make Xermeas more physically bulky, primarily so it will take less damage from priority moves such as Arceus's Extreme Speed and Scizor's Bullet Punch. These EVs will also help Xerneas tank attacks including Gyro Ball and Iron Head from Steel-types such as Bronzong that try to counter it. However this investment in Defense doesn't change any notable OHKOes into 2HKOes. If it is desired, the EVs in Defense can be reallocated to HP for better mixed bulk and to make it easier for Xerneas to better tank special hits. Fully investing in Speed and Special Attack is also a viable option, as it gives Xerneas some utility and allows it to outspeed things before it uses Geomancy. However, after a boost, the extra Speed is mostly superfluous, and it does nothing aside from allowing Xerneas to outrun a few Choice Scarf users such as Shaymin-S and Darkrai, which are beaten anyway due to Geomancy's Special Defense boost. Geomancy Xerneas runs a Modest nature so that its attacks are as strong as possible, allowing it to sweep teams more easily. If you fear an opposing Xerneas setting up Geomancy alongside yours, a Timid nature is usable so that Xerneas is at least guaranteed to Speed tie with it.

Using Geomancy too early in a match will be ineffective, as Xerneas will find itself unable to bypass certain walls. If needed, it can lure in its own counters, such as Choice Band Scizor, and hit them hard with coverage moves such as Focus Blast so that they can be KOed by a Geomancy-boosted attack later on."}, {"Content": "While Geomancy Xerneas is first and foremost a sweeper that can serve as an excellent win condition for a team, it should be noted that it has further utility. Being a Fairy-type, it has a very nice defensive typing, so it is capable of switching into a Zekrom's Outrage or a Giratina-O's Draco Meteor and threaten to KO with Moonblast. Although Power Herb is only used to make Geomancy viable, and is generally a bad item as it does not boost Xerneas's damage output, it's very useful for allowing Xerneas to bluff another set. As no text is shown until after Xerneas has used Geomancy, it can bluff a Choice Scarf very well, which can potentially let it snag an extra KO."}, {"Content": "Xerneas's primary focus is sweeping the opposing team, so partners that can weaken its counters or trap and kill them are appreciated. The most notable of these partners is Mega Gengar, which can trap and use Focus Blast to KO most Steel-types that resist Moonblast. It can also weaken Aegislash that lack Shadow Sneak and defeat Lugia through a combination of Taunt and STAB Shadow Ball. Chansey is also defeated by Mega Gengar, as it cannot hurt or escape from Mega Gengar and will be defeated by Focus Blast and Taunt. Yveltal is similar to Mega Gengar in that it can wear down all of Xerneas's counters, but it does not have the ability to trap them with Shadow Tag. Unlike Gengar, Yveltal can defeat Amoonguss and support Arceus formes. It should be noted that Stealth Rock support is very useful to Xerneas in general, as it not only helps wear down Xerneas's counters, but it drops most of them into OHKO range of Xerneas's attacks. For example, Stealth Rock will remove Lugia's Multiscale and a large chunk of its health, allowing Xerneas to OHKO it with a boosted Moonblast.

Also bear in mind that Aerodactyl is also immune to Trick with Aerodactylite and does not receive extra damage from Knock Off. If necessary, take advantage of these, but at the same time, don't be too reckless as both Aerodactyl and Mega Aerodactyl don't like taking too much unnecessary damage."}, {"Content": "Additionally, ample prediction is the key to using Mega Aerodactyl offensively and effectively. Because it is fast and hard-hitting with a good list of coverage moves, opponents will often switch their Pokemon. Attempt to predict possible switch-ins when attacking early- to mid-game. If Aerodactyl packs Roost, don't forget to use that in defensive situations when possible and necessary. Predicted switches and Roost's side effect (taking away Aerodactyl's Flying typing temporarily) also give Aerodactyl opportunities to use Roost as well. Be sure to Mega Evolve as quickly as possible as otherwise you can be slower than Starmie and Greninja and OHKOed by Hydro Pump."}, {"Content": "Teammates mostly depend on the moves that are selected on Aerodactyl.

Rotom-W handles most Ground- and Water-types Aerodactyl can't KO in time, with the convenient plus of resisting priority moves aimed at Aerodactyl, such as Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Bullet Punch. Tyranitar is also a great teammate, as it can set up Stealth Rock and summon sandstorm, enabling Aerodactyl to stomach special attacks slightly better. Bulky variants also does well with absorbing Electric- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Aerodactyl if required, and appreciateAerodactyl with Aerial Ace's ability to lure in and do huge damage to Mega Venusaur and Conkeldurr.

For Rapid Spin, Starmie makes a good partner due to its great offensive presence and ability to weaken Water- and Ground-type counters, while Mold Breaker Excadrill offers some defensive synergy and takes care of the common Rotom-W. For Defog, Scizor and Latias are good examples, with the former also offering decent priority and STAB U-turn and the latter being able to sponge hits aimed at Aerodactyl.

Moonlight is used as the primary healing move and as such will be used a lot of the time. It is important to note that Moonlight has its shortcomings; it heals less health in sand and rain and has limited PP. Because of this, it should not be used excessively. Psychic is the main STAB move and allows Cresselia to chip down opponents and hit Fighting-types super effectively. Despite its slight nerf, Hidden Power Fire can also work well in this slot. Not only does it dispose of defensive Ferrothorn and Forretress, but it also gives Cresselia a way to get past Scizor. Ice Beam rounds off the coverage and is a superb move for hitting physically based Dragon-types, Pokemon that Cresselia will often need to wall. Cresselia's final moveslot is dedicated to a status move best fit to the team. Toxic allows Cresselia to spread residual damage and slowly defeat Pokemon, whereas Thunder Wave is best fit for teams that have enough offensive firepower to finish off slower threats. However, Thunder Wave is inferior to Toxic when the team has enough defense to stall Pokemon out. Reflect is an option over either of the moves and enhances Cresselia's ability to take physical hits, allowing it to escape Pursuit more easily and can be used to support teammates."}, {"Content": "The EVs are maximized in Defense so that Cresselia can wall powerful physical attackers such as Garchomp, Terrakion, and Landorus-T. A Bold nature is chosen for the same reason, and the rest of the EVs are placed into Cresselia's Special Defense. Leftovers is a standard item for a wall such as Cresselia, providing a means of residual recovery or negating weather damage. In order to perform its role as a physical wall properly, straying from this item choice is not recommended. If one chooses to run Hidden Power Fire, an IV spread of 0 Atk / 30 SpA / 30 Spe achieves the required Hidden Power type while minimizing Foul Play and confusion damage."}, {"Content": "This Cresselia set aims to fulfill the role of a mixed wall with a primary focus on Defense. Because of this, Cresselia is best brought in to check physical attackers or Pokemon that it can efficiently stop. It is best to keep Cresselia as healthy possible and bring it in on Pokemon that are incapable of bypassing its ridiculous defensive limits. Cresselia can be used at essentially any time in the match, depending on what opponents opt to bring out themselves. However, it is a good idea to scout opposing sets to see what Cresselia can and can't handle. For example, because it is particularly vulnerable to being poisoned, Cresselia is best leaving more defensively inclined Pokemon (which can potentially run Toxic) for teammates to deal with. Because Cresselia can also force many switches, setting up hazards before using it to stall out Pokemon is a good idea so that you can take advantage of the entry hazard damage."}, {"Content": "If it hasn't been made clear already, Cresselia loathes Toxic. This makes Pokemon equipped with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy particularly good partners. Chansey can carry either of these moves and also makes an excellent defensive partner, being immune to Cresselia's Ghost-type weakness and taking special hits more capably. Cresselia reciprocates this support by having a resistance to Fighting-type moves. Other Pokemon commonly seen on stall teams are also great teammates for their ability to set hazards and wall the Pokemon that Cresselia cannot. Heatran is a great teammate for Cresselia because it can take care of Scizor, the tier's premier Bug-type. Drought support boosts Moonlight's effect while also getting rid of opposing weather. More specifically, Mega Charizard Y makes a good partner, as it sets up Drought and can take advantage of Thunder Wave support.

It also allows Cresselia to make use of itself after it has done its main job and avoid being dead weight on the team.

Reflect and Light Screen in conjunction allow formerly paper-thin sweepers to gain precious turns to accumulate boosts, and Cresselia needs to set these up before said sweepers can jump into the fray. It is often recommended to use Reflect before Light Screen, as most switch-ins to Cresselia tend to be physically oriented. After it has set up screens, spreading status through Thunder Wave is an excellent way to make use of Cresselia, especially when it is not appropriate to switch directly into a teammate. It is also useful to paralyze opponents before activating the dual screens so that teammates can make the most out of the limited turns that they have.

Drain Punch is Breloom's primary STAB attack, and it provides additional recovery on top of Leech Seed. Protect is a useful scouting move, and it also allows Leech Seed damage to rack up on your opponent while Breloom heals.

Also, Excadrill's typing lends itself to be an excellent teammate for Breloom as well, as it is immune to Poison and resists all of Breloom's weaknesses bar Fire. Finally, hazard setters like Skarmory or Landorus-T will force anything coming in to take a chunk of damage, and this is useful since Breloom will be forcing a lot of switches in order to shake off Leech Seed; Stealth Rock in particular is great for chipping away at Fire-types, especially the omnipresent Talonflame."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Toxic Orb"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 252, "Attack": 4, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 252, "Speed": 0}, "Natures": [5], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Leech Seed", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Drain Punch", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Protect", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Spore", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Leech Seed"}, {"Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Technician"}], "Description": [{"Content": "This set aims to take advantage of Technician and utilize moves that will leave the opposing team extremely worn down. Spore is one of the moves that set Breloom apart from many other attackers, and it could potentially incapacitate a foe for most of the game. It can also be used on a predicted switch to ease prediction, unless a Grass-type or Pokemon with Overcoat are still alive. Bullet Seed is Breloom's most powerful STAB attack after Technician and is useful for breaking through Sturdy and Focus Sash. Mach Punch is a STAB priority move that is useful for hitting weakened or faster foes, and hits really hard after Technician as well. Finally, Rock Tomb is a very useful attack for slowing down anticipated switch-ins for Breloom to take down later; it can hit many common Breloom checks such as Talonflame and Dragonite really hard. Swords Dance can be used over Rock Tomb to allow Breloom to sweep through unprepared teams, as its Attack soars to sky-high levels after a +2 boost; however, its STAB coverage isn't that great and it can get walled by Pokemon like Aegislash, Charizard-Y, and Gengar with relative ease."}, {"Content": "Breloom can also use Force Palm over Rock Tomb as a reliable and more powerful secondary STAB attack if it needs to hit harder than it would with Mach Punch, and this is useful for getting past defensive threats like Ferrothorn.

However, since Grass-types are immune to Spore, if you predict that one is going to switch in, try using Mach Punch or Rock Tomb. If something slightly faster than Breloom is switching in, it can use Rock Tomb to slow it down, hopefully to the point where Breloom can outspeed the opposing Pokemon and finish it off."}, {"Content": "A Fire-type or a teammate with a Fire-type move is very useful to have to get rid of opposing Grass-types that are immune to Spore. Heatran is an excellent example of a Fire-type teammate, as it resists Flying, as well as dual-resisting Ice and being immune to Poison. Because Mega Venusaur essentially counters Breloom, a counter to it, such as Latios, is recommended to get it out of the way. A Stealth Rock setter is also a great teammate to have, as it chips away at the opposing team's health and also weakens Fire- and Flying-types, especially the omnipresent Talonflame. Rock-types are also a great choice for directly damaging Fire- and Flying-types. Hippowdon is a bulky Ground-type that can easily take care of Aegislash and Talonflame.

Iron Head is a reliable Steel-type STAB move that deals with targets that resist Dark-type attacks, most notably Fairy-types. Swords Dance allows Bisharp to boost its solid base 125 Attack even higher and attempt a sweep. Substitute can be used instead to ease prediction with Sucker Punch and block status moves aimed at it. Bisharp can also use Pursuit in the last slot to trap many popular threats, most notably Aegislash, as Defiant negates the Attack drop from King's Shield.

For example, Life Orb guarantees the 2HKO on Azumarill with Iron Head. However, BlackGlasses can be used to avoid recoil while still boosting Bisharp's more commonly used Dark-type moves. Low Kick can be used to OHKO Tyranitar, Mega Lucario, and opposing Bisharp, and is also the best option against Mega Aggron. An Assault Vest with an EV spread of 64 HP / 252 Atk / 192 SpD is an interesting option for Bisharp that allows it to survive powerful special attacks and reliably trap Defog Latios by using Pursuit."}, {"Content": "Bisharp is best used to apply heavy offensive pressure to your opponent. Switch in using Bisharp's resistances or a predicted switch, and use Knock Off to weaken any switch-in early in the match. Defiant forces your opponent to play carefully with Intimidate Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Defog users such as Latias, because Bisharp can gain a free boost with clever switching. Later in the match, when Bisharp's counters have been removed, use Swords Dance against something Bisharp can force out in order to sweep. Once it gains a boost, Bisharp is incredibly difficult to stop. However, Sucker Punch must be used carefully, as it is predictable and very easy to exploit."}, {"Content": "Great offensive teammates for Bisharp include Pokemon that can defeat bulky physical walls. Water-types such as Starmie and Rotom-W pair well with Bisharp and can defeat Hippowdon and Gliscor. Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y can defeat bulky Steel-types such as Skarmory and Mega Aggron.

Fire Blast is Houndoom's primary STAB; its high Base Power with negligible drawbacks makes Mega Houndoom a very fierce attacker compared to Pokemon that rely on less powerful moves as their main attack. Dark Pulse is secondary STAB that offers reliable accuracy, a handy flinch chance, and reasonably good neutral coverage with Fire Blast. Taunt is a useful move that aids in setting up against phazers that can't damage Houndoom otherwise, such as Mandibuzz. It also allows Houndoom to set up in the face of status users that rely on status such as Porygon 2, Chansey, or Heatran lacking Earth Power. On top of this, Taunt prevents walls such as Chansey from recovering, letting Houndoom wear down defensive teams more easily. Destiny Bond is more suited for fighting offensive teams as Houndoom has trouble muscling past some offensive staples such as Keldeo, Tyranitar, and Terrakion. Destiny Bond can make short work of these Pokemon early-game. Hidden Power Fighting is a very good option as it can deal considerable damage to Tyranitar, which otherwise easily counters Houndoom. Hidden Power Grass is a second viable Hidden Power which has the ability to hit a number of good checks to Houndoom such as Keldeo, Azumarill, and Terrakion very hard. Flame Charge is an option for a pseudo double dance set, letting Houndoom boost its Speed to clean up late-game."}, {"Content": "Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs optimize Mega Houndoom's sweeping and wallbreaking abilities. A Timid nature is mandatory, as without a Speed-positive nature a large number of important Speed tiers are missed. The remaining four EVs go into Defense as opposed to HP as it lets Houndoom take less entry hazard damage. Flash Fire is the ideal ability as the boost persists when Houndoom is Mega-Evolved and gives it a free switch-in if played correctly."}, {"Content": "Specially defensive Heatran with Earth Power is a counter to Mega Houndoom, but it is nearly powerless if it lacks Earth Power and the latter has Taunt. Scouting for Heatran's moveset before deploying Houndoom may let it set up for free on Heatran. The easiest way to accomplish this is to switch Houndoom into Heatran as it uses Lava Plume, then switch out. Houndoom's typing is convenient for beating Ghost-types that like to throw around burns, such as mono-attack Gengar and standard Sableye; these are perhaps the best switch-in opportunities for it. Mandibuzz is complete setup bait for Mega Houndoom should the latter have Taunt, so exploit this. Chansey should be Taunted to prevent recovery and status, making it easy to wear down and switch into. Mega Venusaur is also a pretty good Taunt target for preventing Leech Seeds and Synthesis, again making it easy to wear down and switch into, or outright beat. Mega Houndoom functions quite well as a wallbreaker; setting it up mid-game to break down bulky Pokemon for the rest of your team is where it is most effective. Destiny Bond's primary targets are Keldeo, Terrakion, Tyranitar, and basically anything slower than Houndoom that it can't beat and will probably respond with an OHKO. It can also be used to take down Chansey if it is dumb enough to KO Houndoom with Seismic Toss."}, {"Content": "Stealth Rock is a serious issue for Houndoom, and Defog or Rapid Spin support is crucial. Scizor performs in this role relatively well as it lures Will-O-Wisp and offensive Fire-type moves for Houndoom's Flash Fire; it is also a reasonable switch into Tyranitar, one of Houndoom's best counters. Latios as a Defogger can deal with Keldeo and Breloom pretty effectively. Drought Ninetales, especially with a Heat Rock, gives Mega Houndoom a huge amount of power without any need for setup. +2 Houndoom is so strong in the sun, it can OHKO Blissey. Landorus-T is excellent at absorbing strong Ground- and Fighting-type moves aimed at Houndoom, while also taking some Rock-type moves comfortably. Landorus-T also can counter Talonflame, a good offensive check to Houndoom. Dugtrio is an incredibly valuable trapping partner as it is capable of trapping and KOing two of Houndoom's biggest adversaries: Tyranitar and Heatran. Azumarill is quite capable of switching into and beating prominent offensive checks to Houndoom such as Greninja and Keldeo. Rotom-W is a solid teammate for Houndoom as it can take on a number of Houndoom's greatest checks such as Keldeo, Talonflame, and Azumarill and generate momentum with Volt Switch for Houndoom to come in safely.

Focus Blast is great for OHKOing Tyranitar, as well as to prevent Landorus from being walled by Skarmory. It is also Landorus's most powerful move with which to hit Chansey. Because Landorus has such a good movepool, the last slot really depends on what the rest of the team needs. Sludge Wave is a fantastic option to hit Clefable, Sylveon, and Azumarill on the switch. It is also more powerful than Psychic, making it the best option for neutral hits. Knock Off is good for luring in Chansey and removing its Eviolite, thus crippling it for the rest of the match. Lastly, Landorus can be an effective user of Stealth Rock if no other setter is available on a team. Rock Slide is an option in the last slot as well, as it can OHKO Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y on the switch. U-turn can also be used to grab momentum on a predicted switch and hits Latios and Latias for super effective damage, but usually coverage is preferred."}, {"Content": "An EV spread of 48 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe with a Modest nature can be used in order to outspeed positive-natured Mega Gyarados and 216 Speed Kyurem-B while getting an extra boost in power, although usually this is irrelevant since Landorus already hits so hard. A Modest nature should only be used if the rest of the team can cover both Charizard formes, as well as other Pokemon with base 100 Speed such as Manaphy and Mega Medicham. It is important that if using a physical attack such as Knock Off or Rock Slide, a Naive nature is used over Timid."}, {"Content": "Landorus is one of the best stallbreakers in the tier, being able to take down common stall cores such as the core of Mega Venusaur and Heatran, as well as having access to Knock Off to cripple Chansey. Knock Off is especially useful when used in tandem with other special attackers such as Charizard Y and Thundurus. Because of this, it can be used both early- and late-game. Either use it to break through special walls for another Pokemon to clean up late-game or vice versa. Double switching into Bisharp or other Pursuit trappers on a predicted switch into Latios, Latias, or Chansey is also helpful to eliminate Landorus's counters as early as possible."}, {"Content": "The best partners to Landorus are other special attackers. Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus, and Keldeo all work well with it, as they can all wear down their similar counters by repeated attacking. Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Aegislash also make good partners, as they can trap Latios and Latias. Bisharp and Tyranitar can even deal enough damage to wear down Chansey with their STAB Pursuit. Because faster Pokemon such as Garchomp, Keldeo, and Greninja can be problematic, Azumarill also makes a great partner, being able to defeat all of them."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Life Orb"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 252, "HP": 0, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 4, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [24, 16], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earth Power", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Psychic", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Focus Blast", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Knock Off", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Sludge Wave", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Stealth Rock", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Special Attacker"}], "Name": "Landorus", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 0, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Sand Force"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Sheer Force"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 115, "HP": 89, "Attack": 125, "Defense": 90, "SpecialDefense": 80, "Speed": 101}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Attract", "Description": "Targets of the opposite gender are infatuated and have a 50% chance to do nothing."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Block", "Description": "The target cannot switch out."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brick Break", "Description": "Destroys Light Screen and Reflect, then hits."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulk Up", "Description": "Boosts Atk and Def 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulldoze", "Description": "Lowers target's Speed by 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Calm Mind", "Description": "Boosts SpA and SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dig", "Description": "User is made invulnerable for one turn, then hits the next turn."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Double Team", "Description": "Boosts evasion 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earth Power", "Description": "10% chance to lower SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earthquake", "Description": "Hits Pokemon using Dig with double Base Power."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Explosion", "Description": "Faints the user."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Extrasensory", "Description": "10% chance to flinch."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Facade", "Description": "Has 140 Base Power when burned, paralyzed, or poisoned."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Fissure", "Description": "Will OHKO the target."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Fling", "Description": "Throws the user's hold item at the foe.

Earthquake, which is bolstered by Earth Plate and full investment in Groudon's enormous Attack stat, deals tremendous damage to almost everything that doesn't resist it; it cleanly OHKOes Dialga, a feat that few Pokemon can manage. It also deals over half to most support Arceus variants, pressuring them greatly if they try to come in and use Defog to clear away Stealth Rock. Stone Edge clips Ho-Oh's wings several times over and OHKOes 0 HP Yveltal after Stealth Rock damage, provided it has a Defense-lowering nature. It also does solid damage to Lugia, though it won't usually 2HKO. Dragon Tail is generally best in the last moveslot, as it allows Groudon to check Swords Dance Normal Arceus in a pinch while getting valuable chip damage on Giratina-O, which otherwise walls this set completely. It can also be run over Stone Edge if your team has a solid answer to Ho-Oh. Toxic is a great move on this set, as it cripples Landorus-T and Lugia, both of which can otherwise handle Groudon with ease. Lava Plume is also useful for hitting Skarmory and potentially burning Landorus-T, though it lacks the general utility of Toxic."}, {"Content": "Another potential move that can be run on this set is Dragon Claw, which allows Groudon to break Giratina-O a lot easier, nailing 252 HP variants for a 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage. However, it is not as useful as the other moves and Giratina-O generally runs substantial Defense investment, so Dragon Claw is somewhat unreliable."}, {"Content": "The EVs maximize Groudon's Speed and attacking power, as the focus of the set is to make Groudon extremely threatening offensively. An Adamant nature with and Earth Plate is usually the preferred variant of this set, as it guarantees the OHKO on Dialga with Earthquake. A Jolly nature can also be used with Life Orb to retain the OHKO on Dialga while outpacing other Pokemon in the base 90 Speed group, such as Rayquaza, Kyurem-W, and Yveltal, assuming none of them also run a Speed-boosting nature. Life Orb significantly boosts Groudon's coverage moves as well, allowing for a clean OHKO on 0 HP Yveltal with Stone Edge. Groudon can even 2HKO Lugia with Life Orb-boosted Stone Edge, assuming Groudon is running an Adamant nature and Multiscale is not active. However, Life Orb recoil cuts down Groudon's bulk significantly."}, {"Content": "If you want a bulkier Groudon, you can drop the Speed investment as needed. However, you should always run at least 76 Speed EVs, assuming an Adamant nature, in order to allow Groudon to outspeed 0 Speed Yveltal so that it can smack it with Stone Edge before getting wrecked by Foul Play. You can also take some EVs out of Attack, but you need at least 220 EVs to retain the OHKO on Dialga, assuming an Adamant nature and Earth Plate as the item."}, {"Content": "This Groudon set operates effectively on offensive teams that need a reliable Stealth Rock user which can OHKO Dialga, is while being hard to set up on and able to check swords Dance Normal Arceus in a pinch. Unlike the support Groudon build, this set uses its offensive pressure and Speed rather than bulk to force switches and buy time to set up Stealth Rock, so be aggressive and don't play it like the first set. Rather, make use of Groudon's Speed, don't mindlessly use Earthquake if your opponent has Pokemon that are immune to Ground, and don't let it take damage it doesn't need to take."}, {"Content": "Although Toxic will cripple most of them, this set can be checked fairly easily by physical walls that can handle Earthquake such as Multiscale Lugia, Giratina, Landorus-T, Skarmory, Gliscor, and Grass Arceus. Yveltal switches in easily on all of these Pokemon and destroys them all with its powerful STAB attacks, making it a powerful offensive partner to Groudon, which can return the favor by wrecking Tyranitar and special tanks such as Sylveon with Earthquake. Aside from that, this set retains the same general weaknesses of the first set: it is vulnerable to powerful special attackers, particularly Kyogre and Kyurem-W, and is crippled by burns. Ho-Oh, Water Arceus, and Palkia remain great teammates for these reasons.

Fire Punch is the primary choice for the last move, as it beats many Pokemon that would otherwise wall Groudon; it easily KOes Skarmory, Bronzong, Grass Arceus, and Mega Scizor, while also being the strongest option against Landorus-T and Gliscor, thanks to the boost from Drought. On the other hand, Swords Dance pumps up Groudon's Attack stat even further and gives it greater power to bust through walls such as Lugia and Giratina. Groudon can potentially sweep entire teams early on in a match if it manages to nab a boost from both Rock Polish and Swords Dance, but this is difficult to do without support from dual screens or significant bulk investment.

If you desire more bulk, you can run less Speed investment: 136 Speed lets it get past Choice Scarf Garchomp after a boost, 124 EVs allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Palkia, and with an investment of a mere 56 EVs, it outpaces positive-natured Choice Scarf base 90s such as Kyogre and Zekrom."}, {"Content": "There are a few more ways to customize Groudon if it is running Swords Dance. Lum Berry is a nice option: it allows Groudon to beat Giratina in conjunction with Swords Dance and can potentially allow it to set up a second boost in the face of support Arceus formes that attempt to use Will-O-Wisp. However, Groudon cannot sweep as well with just a Rock Polish boost and without the added power from Life Orb. If you want to set up both Rock Polish and Swords Dance more consistently, you can run a very bulky spread: 252 HP / 132 Def / 124 Spe, with an Impish nature and Earth Plate as the item. This grants Groudon enough Speed to get past Choice Scarf Palkia after a Rock Polish while giving it enough bulk to set up far more easily. However, it lacks a lot of immediate power compared to more offensive builds and isn't as efficient as a pure sweeper."}, {"Content": "Rock Polish Groudon works best a late-game sweeper, saved until it's main checks are weakened. Obviously, you shouldn't try to set up a Rock Polish until the opponent's answer to Rock Polish Groudon such as Lugia or Giratina is weakened. Swords Dance can give Groudon more versatility against bulkier teams and a greater ability to break walls, making Groudon more useful early- or mid-game. However, even with Swords Dance, Groudon has trouble piercing through walls such as Gliscor, so make sure that such roadblocks are taken out first. Use your Groudon's offensive presence and solid physical bulk to buy a turn to set up if you can; trying to set up on a powerful special attack can possibly leave Groudon dead or with too little health to sweep."}, {"Content": "This set has a very difficult time forcing its way through Gliscor, and it can still be walled by Skarmory, Grass Arceus, or Giratina depending on what moves it decides to run.

Ho-Oh is also an excellent partner if Groudon is not running Fire Punch, as it can take care of Skarmory and Grass Arceus while softening up walls such as Lugia, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon with potential Sacred Fire burns. As a bonus, Ho-Oh handles Choice Scarf Shaymin-S , which can outspeed Groudon after a Rock Polish and revenge kill it with Seed Flare, easily. Mixed Zekrom is also a notable teammate for this set, as it can lure in and destroy bulky Ground-types such as Gliscor and Hippowdon, which Groudon may have trouble beating by itself, with a powerful Draco Meteor.

Stealth Rock is a very useful support move for Groudon: it is one of the few viable users of the move in Ubers, and Groudon's bulk and typing usually give it ample chances to come in and set it up in battle. Stone Edge is very helpful, as it allows Groudon to OHKO Ho-Oh and significantly damage Yveltal, both of which are dangerous threats that could otherwise freely come in on Groudon. If these threats aren't of concern to your team, Lava Plume is also a solid option for allowing Groudon to KO Skarmory which can otherwise switch freely in on Groudon and use Defog to remove Stealth Rock, easily, while also hitting Landorus-T and potentially crippling it with a burn.

Dragon Tail allows Groudon to phaze dangerous threats such as Arceus and Mega Mewtwo X, and is generally preferred over Roar, as it gets valuable chip damage on enemy Pokemon and is not blocked by Taunt. However, Roar has perfect accuracy and phazes Substitute users such as Ho-Oh, although Groudon will still need Stone Edge to check it."}, {"Content": "You will always want to fully invest in Groudon's bulk with the set, usually maximizing its Defense so that it can check physical threats as needed. Leftovers is the preferred item in most cases, as it is Groudon's only form of recovery.

Heat Rock can be used if you're running a dedicated sun team to extend Drought's duration to eight turns rather than five, but this is only recommended if you are using sun-reliant Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X or Mega Houndoom.

However, specially defensive Groudon is not nearly as good at checking the physical threats it is otherwise meant to."}, {"Content": "Groudon can switch easily into physical attackers such as Zekrom, Tyranitar, Mega Lucario, Terrakion, and most Swords Dance Arceus formes, as well as bulky Steel-types such as Aegislash and Jirachi, giving it great opportunities to set up Stealth Rock, phaze, or spread status. It fits best on balanced or stall teams that need a physically bulky Pokemon which can set up Stealth Rock reliably. It can work on more offensively oriented teams, but support Groudon isn't as good at maintaining momentum, so it would be better to stick to the more offensively inclined sets."}, {"Content": "Deciding when to use Stealth Rock takes a bit more care than it might seem at first glance, as taking a turn to use the move can cost you a lot of momentum. Save it for when you predict the opponent to switch out or are in against something that doesn't threaten Groudon too much such as Tyranitar. More specifically, you should never use Stealth Rock in the face of Swords Dance Arceus and Ho-Oh, two horribly dangerous threats which Groudon usually only has enough bulk to check once (and it is a very risky switch-in to Ho-Oh regardless). Letting Groudon take a burn or sacrificing it just to set up Stealth Rock is also not advised if you still need Groudon to check something on the opponent's team, such as a Choice Scarf Zekrom. In general, don't play with Groudon too recklessly if you really need it to check something that might otherwise sweep your team."}, {"Content": "Drought isn't something you can actively make use of most of the time due to its short duration, but Groudon's good synergy with Fire-types such as Ho-Oh can potentially give you time to make use of it. It can also be used to help slow Kyogre's onslaught if you are having trouble against it, but switching Groudon directly into Kyogre is generally a terrible idea unless you are strongly predicting Thunder or have no other choice. Drought can also backfire on Groudon by boosting enemy Fire-type moves for threats such as Ho-Oh and Mega Blaziken, so be careful."}, {"Content": "As Groudon is the one doing the supporting, it doesn't require too much support itself. However, it appreciates teammates that can handle powerful special attacks as it cannot take many of them, especially from Pokemon such as Kyogre and Kyurem-W. Palkia is a solid check to most variants of Kyogre, while Water Arceus checks Kyurem-W and Choiced Kyogre well. As a bonus, Water Arceus is a solid check to Ho-Oh, which is very good to have if you are not running Stone Edge on Groudon. Blissey is a good catch-all special wall that can take many special attacks aimed at Groudon, and it can heal Groudon with Wish or cure burns it might have taken with Aromatherapy. Chansey and Sylveon can perform similar roles as well, but like Blissey, they can all be potentially sniped by Mega Gengar, so exercise caution when using them.

Recover aids Fairy Arceus in setting up multiple Calm Mind boosts, and ensures it can survive to clean up late-game while checking relevant threats early on. In the fourth moveslot, Thunder is slashed first because it hits Ho-Oh super effectively; Ho-Oh is otherwise a major check to Fairy Arceus. Thunder is also useful if your team has problems with specially defensive Kyogre. Next, Will-O-Wisp makes Fairy Arceus a middle ground between sweeper and supporter, allowing it to check physically oriented threats while retaining its ability to clean up late-game with its excellent mono-attacking coverage. In the third slash, Psyshock deserves mention as it allows Fairy Arceus to win Calm Mind wars with opposing Arceus formes by targeting their unboosted Defense stats. A couple of other options can be used in the fourth moveslot. Fire Blast handles pesky Steel-types bar Heatran, and Flamethrower is a weaker but more accurate alternative. Refresh can also be run, but Fairy Arceus is largely outclassed as a status-bypassing sweeper by Water Arceus, notably because the latter handles Ho-Oh better. The main draw of using Refresh Fairy Arceus over Water Arceus is that it can set up on Palkia much more effectively."}, {"Content": "Maximum HP EVs make good use of Fairy Arceus's typing and natural bulk, while maximum Speed EVs allow it to outrun everything below its Speed tier and Speed tie any Arceus at worst. Alternatively, run the same spread as support Fairy Arceus (252 HP / 144 Def / 112 Spe), as both sets share a niche in checking the same threats. If you so wish, investing 96 EVs in SpA allows Fairy Arceus to OHKO 248 HP Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage. 88 SpA EVs allow Fairy Arceus to OHKO 0 HP Mega Gengar with +1 Psyshock, and 196 SpA EVs allow it to KO the 248 HP Perish Trapper variant after Stealth Rock damage. The required EVs can be siphoned from HP or Speed; just note that Fairy Arceus should retain enough Speed to outrun Timid Palkia and Jolly Mega Kangaskhan."}, {"Content": "Although this set can sweep late-game, don't be hesitant to switch it into the threats it checks, but remain vigilant in steering clear of status moves and super effective coverage moves. Tread lightly around Mega Gengar; you don't want to lose your sweeper to a reckless switch early-game. Furthermore, it is inadvisable to be too hasty in setting up Calm Mind in an attempt to break holes in the opposing team early-to-mid-game, when Fairy Arceus's checks and counters are still healthy. Despite having sweeping potential, this set's main focus is still to stay healthy for the bulk of the game and check relevant threats with its defenses and typing; sweeping should only be attempted late-game, when the opposing team is weakened to the extent that Fairy Arceus can clean up with a single Calm Mind boost."}, {"Content": "Ground-type Stealth Rock setters make good teammates. Note that using this set means you give up the utility of Defog; while it is not a necessity on every team, you should have a way to keep entry hazards in check. Giratina-O is a good teammate in this regard; besides being able to use Defog, it can also KO Ho-Oh with Stone Edge while Fairy Arceus checks the Dark-types it is weak to. As this set aims to clean with Calm Mind-boosted Judgments late-game, teammates adept at applying offensive pressure on its checks are strongly recommended. An example is Substitute Ho-Oh, which can switch in and set up on the majority of the Steel-types that check Fairy Arceus, following which it can use its dual STAB moves to threaten the opposing team behind the safety of its Substitute. Life Orb Groudon can also accomplish the same feat, threatening a sweep of its own if it manages to switch in on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn or Aegislash that check Fairy Arceus."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Pixie Plate"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 252, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 4, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [24], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Judgment", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Calm Mind", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Recover", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Psyshock", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Thunder", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Will-O-Wisp", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Calm Mind"}, {"Abilities": [], "Description": [{"Content": "Judgment is Fairy Arceus's obligatory STAB move. It hits most targets neutrally for good damage, and hits important targets such as Palkia, Mega Mewtwo X, and Giratina-O super effectively. Recover grants Fairy Arceus the longevity it requires to perform its supportive role throughout the match. Defog clears all entry hazards from both sides of the field; Fairy Arceus can find many opportunities to switch in on Pokemon that it threatens, such as Palkia, and utilize these free turns to use the move. In conjunction with its respectable natural bulk and Fairy typing's neutrality to most types, Fairy Arceus can utilize Will-O-Wisp to check most commonly seen physical attackers, such as Groudon, Mega Kangaskhan, and Extreme Killer Arceus. Toxic is an alternative status move that can be used, having certain merits that distinguish it from Will-O-Wisp. Firstly, Toxic cripples one of Fairy Arceus's most common and potent checks, Ho-Oh, as it switches in. Secondly, Toxic can be used to pressure opposing Defog users, Calm Mind sweepers, and walls such as Lugia better than Will-O-Wisp can, as the cumulative nature of Toxic damage means that Pokemon stricken with it are essentially put on a timer that resets only if they switch out (as opposed to a burnt Pokemon, which can stick around indefinitely as long as it possesses reliable recovery). Note that using Toxic leaves Fairy Arceus practically helpless against the numerous Steel-types that populate the Ubers tier. Aside from the listed moves, Fairy Arceus has a couple of other options. Stone Edge can be run in the third moveslot to KO most variants of Ho-Oh (all of them if Stealth Rock is up). In the same vein, Earthquake hits two of Fairy Arceus's other checks, Mega Gengar and Heatran, super effectively. While being worthwhile options if one's team struggles with these Pokemon, keep in mind that running these moves means that Fairy Arceus will miss out on the general utility a status move provides. Lastly, if your team has an alternative means of keeping entry hazards in check when needed, Roar can be used over Defog to phaze common switch-ins. The most notable of these is Ho-Oh, which is 4x weak to Stealth Rock. Spikes support greatly increases Roar's effectiveness when phazing Steel-type switch-ins that are resistant to Stealth Rock."}, {"Content": "Maximum HP EVs allow Fairy Arceus to switch in on many moderately powerful neutral hits, such as Hydro Pump from Palkia in neutral weather. 112 Speed EVs with a Timid nature are used to outspeed everything up to Jolly Garchomp; most significantly, this allows Fairy Arceus to outspeed and KO Timid Palkia with Judgment as well as check Mega Kangaskhan with Will-O-Wisp. The remaining 144 EVs are invested in Defense For Fairy Arceus to better stomach physical hits such as Mewtwo's Psystrike; they also come in handy in the event of a Will-O-Wisp miss against Pokemon such as Life Orb Groudon and Mega Kangaskhan. Alternatively, the 144 EVs can be invested in Special Defense for some added insurance against Palkia and Xerneas; boosted Geomancy Xerneas's Moonblast only has a 25% to OHKO Fairy Arceus after Stealth Rock damage. This spread can also better insure Fairy Arceus against +1 / +1 Calm Mind Arceus formes in a pinch; a +1 4 SpA Judgment from a type-neutral Arceus forme has a 8.2% chance to 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage, as opposed to a guaranteed 2HKO if the 144 SpD EVs are not run. Note that with this spread, Roar should be used as Fairy Arceus's other moves are ineffectual against the Pokemon it is supposed to check."}, {"Content": "Make the best of Fairy Arceus's typing by not hesitating to switch it in on Pokemon it can force out with the threat of a burn or a super effective Judgment. Examples of such Pokemon include Mega Mewtwo X, Palkia, and Groudon. However, Fairy Arceus's typing leaves it vulnerable to a popular and potent trapper: Mega Gengar. If you see the opponent has a Gengar in Team Preview, caution should be exercised in switching in Fairy Arceus on Pokemon it checks, especially if Gengar has already Mega Evolved; a simple double switch could doom it. A good way to prevent Mega Gengar from getting the better of Fairy Arceus would be to get prior damage on it before it Mega Evolves; Judgment does 37-43% to 0 HP / 0 SpD Gengar and 30-35% to Mega Gengar, meaning that if you hit it once then switch out before it Mega Evolves, it will be hard-pressed to switch in on Fairy Arceus again if Stealth Rock is up. Also, be wary of super effective coverage moves on Pokemon Fairy Arceus otherwise checks, such as Iron Tail and Poison Jab on Mega Mewtwo X and Sludge Bomb on Darkrai. Scout for these moves with your other Pokemon, as far as team structure permits. You should also be careful of switching Fairy Arceus into possible status moves, even if you can force out or KO the user afterwards, as status greatly diminishes Fairy Arceus's supporting capabilities. Paralysis destroys its Speed advantage over many Pokemon, and burn/poison wears away at its health, forcing it to use Recover more than otherwise necessary. Lastly, don't use Defog too hastily (basically, if it benefits your opponent more than you). Spamming Judgment or spreading status is the wiser option over using Defog if the opponent's entry hazard setter can set up hazards again with relative ease."}, {"Content": "Ground-type Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T and Gliscor are good teammates, as they can set up Stealth Rock reliably and consistently and can check Ho-Oh with their typing and physical bulk if the need arises. Similarly, Groudon can be a nice partner, although Drought has the nasty side effect of strengthening Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire. At any rate, none of these Pokemon have the means to switch into Brave Bird/Sacred Fire repeatedly, and the best way to keep Ho-Oh at bay is ensuring Stealth Rock stays up. When choosing among these Stealth Rock setters, keep in mind that each one is unique in the support it provides. Groudon has Drought, learns Fire Punch, and can phaze with Roar/Dragon Tail, Landorus-T can gain momentum with U-turn and has Intimidate, and Gliscor can sponge status from certain Pokemon and can stallbreak with Taunt. Furthermore, having a Ground-type and Fairy Arceus on your team keeps opposing Choice Zekrom users guessing as to which of its STAB moves to use, with mispredictions being duly punished. Curiously enough, Ho-Oh is a much of a friend as it is a foe; it handily checks the Steel-types that give Fairy Arceus a hard time, and is hence a great partner. Kyogre can threaten Fairy Arceus massively with its rain-boosted STAB moves. Palkia is a good partner as it is essentially the only Kyogre check that doesn't compound your team's weakness to Ho-Oh. For that matter, specially defensive Kyogre can be a good teammate as it can check some variants of Palkia as well as Geomancy Xerneas, which can set up on Fairy Arceus."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Pixie Plate"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 252, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 144, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 112}, "Natures": [24], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Judgment", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Recover", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Defog", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Toxic", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Will-O-Wisp", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Support"}], "Name": "Arceus-Fairy", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 0, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Multitype"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 120, "HP": 120, "Attack": 120, "Defense": 120, "SpecialDefense": 120, "Speed": 120}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aerial Ace", "Description": "Ignores accuracy modifiers."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Ancient Power", "Description": "10% chance to boost all stats 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Aqua Tail", "Description": "No additional effect."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Avalanche", "Description": "Doubles in power if damaged by the target."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Blizzard", "Description": "10% chance to freeze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brick Break", "Description": "Destroys Light Screen and Reflect, then hits."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brine", "Description": "Base Power doubles if foe's HP is 50% or less."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulldoze", "Description": "Lowers target's Speed by 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bullet Seed", "Description": "Hits 2-5 times in one turn."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Calm Mind", "Description": "Boosts SpA and SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Charge Beam", "Description": "70% chance to boost SpA 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Cosmic Power", "Description": "Boosts Def and SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Cut", "Description": "No additional effect."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dark Pulse", "Description": "20% chance to flinch."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Defog", "Description": "Lowers target's evasion 1 stage.

Infiltrator is Noivern's preferred ability, as it allows Noivern to hit through Substitutes, hence giving Noivern valuable utility, but Frisk can be used to scout the opponent's item. Air Slash can be used over Hurricane as a more reliable Flying-type STAB move, but its a low Base Power limits its effectiveness. Noivern can also use the powerful Boomburst, but it often has trouble fitting it into a set, as it does not provide super effective coverage against anything, and the ability to hit through Substitutes isn't as valuable when using Infiltrator as an ability."}, {"Content": "This set shows Noivern primarily being used as a revenge killer. Bring Noivern in to revenge a Pokemon, and use the appropriate coverage move. Try not to use Draco Meteor immediately, as the Special Attack drop can be debilitating early in the game when you don't fully know the opponent's team. Instead, either use an appropriate coverage move for who you expect will switch in, or U-turn to scout what the opponent's check to Noivern is. In general, using U-turn throughout the game is helpful to scout your opponent's sets, which works great when using Frisk.

It is ideal to use Switcheroo on Pokemon that don't appreciate Choice Specs, such as Darmanitan, or Pokemon that are setting up, such as Suicune. Try and use this move sparingly and only when needed, as the Choice Specs are what mainly gives Noivern its power. U-turn is ideally used on incoming threats to provide momentum and gain the upper hand for your team. However, be wary of using U-turn too much if there is Stealth Rock on your side of the field, as Noivern does not appreciate the 25% health loss when switching in.

A Jolly nature gives Medicham the maximum Speed possible to help ensure you'll outspeed certain Pokemon, although an Adamant nature can provide more power, enabling Mega Medicham to reach the impressive base 249 Attack. Overall, a Jolly nature provides more consistency at the cost of greater wallbreaking power."}, {"Content": "Mega Medicham is basically a nuke, but it has trouble switching into battle, so your team should have ways to bring it in safely, such as U-turn or Volt Switch. Successfully setting up a Substitute is instrumental to doing heavy damage with Mega Medicham since you don't have to predict as much; Medicham can attack much more freely when it doesn't fear a potential OHKO in return. Setting up a Substitute on the prediction of a Ghost-type switch-in or faster fighting resist is key. Mega Medicham can deal the maximum amount of devastation to enemy teams if you're setting up a Substitute when you predict the enemy to switch out into another Pokemon or hitting a predicted switch in for the most possible damage."}, {"Content": "Good teammates for Mega Medicham are Pokemon with access to U-turn or Volt Switch because it doesn't like hard switching into attacks due to its frailty. Among Pokemon found on VoltTurning teams, Scizor is a great partner because Mega Medicham takes care of many checks to Scizor. Rotom-W is a great Volt Switch user that is capable of stomaching attacks from common priority users that want to pick off Mega Medicham and retaliate by crippling it with a burn. Mid- to late-game sweepers such as Lucario or Terrakion are great teammates for Mega Medicham because they can sweep with ease after Mega Medicham has already broken down all the enemy walls."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Medichamite"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 0, "Attack": 252, "Defense": 4, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [11, 0], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "High Jump Kick", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Fire Punch", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Ice Punch", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Zen Headbutt", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bullet Punch", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Substitute", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Physical Attacker"}], "Name": "Medicham", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 1, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Pure Power"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Telepathy"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 60, "HP": 60, "Attack": 60, "Defense": 75, "SpecialDefense": 75, "Speed": 80}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Acupressure", "Description": "Boosts a random stat 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Attract", "Description": "Targets of the opposite gender are infatuated and have a 50% chance to do nothing."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Baton Pass", "Description": "User switches, but passes on all stat changes and some special conditions."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bide", "Description": "Charges for 2-3 turns; returns double the damage received in those turns."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Body Slam", "Description": "30% chance to paralyze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brick Break", "Description": "Destroys Light Screen and Reflect, then hits."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulk Up", "Description": "Boosts Atk and Def 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bullet Punch", "Description": "The user always attacks first."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Calm Mind", "Description": "Boosts SpA and SpD 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Captivate", "Description": "Lowers an opposite gender foe's SpA 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confusion", "Description": "10% chance to confuse."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Counter", "Description": "If hit by a physical attack, returns double the damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Detect", "Description": "Prevents anything from working on the user that turn."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Double Team", "Description": "Boosts evasion 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Double-Edge", "Description": "Has 1/3 recoil."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Drain Punch", "Description": "Leeches 50% damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dream Eater", "Description": "Leeches 50% of the damage dealt.

However, Swords Dance is great in that it makes Scizor's Bullet Punch terrifyingly strong, strong enough to sweep on its own, and allows the team to be much less dependent on Espeon for a final sweep. In the second slot, Substitute protects Scizor from critical hits and makes it much easier to pull off a safe pass to a teammate. However, the lack of Leftovers means Scizor will have to rely on teammates to pass other forms of recovery, namely Wish, Aqua Ring, and Ingrain.

Shell Smash is the move that makes Cloyster so threatening; by doubling its offensive stats and Speed, it instantly becomes a threatening sweeper. Cloyster's main STAB attack, Icicle Spear, will consistently be 125 Base Power thanks to Skill Link, and after a Shell Smash, it will inflict massive damage on anything that doesn't resist it; even physical walls such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory take large amounts of damage. Rock Blast is an excellent coverage move, as not only is it boosted by Skill Link, it also provides great neutral coverage, hitting Fire- and Ice-types super effectively, and is Cloyster's main way of dealing with Talonflame, Gyarados, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard X. The fourth slot is based on personal choice. Hydro Pump is often the better option, as it allows Cloyster to break through physically defensive checks such as Skamory, Forretress, and Scizor with a bit of prior damage, while Razor Shell is Cloyster's best option against Assault Vest Tyranitar, Specially Defensive Jirachi, and Specially Defensive Heatran. However, Ice Shard can be used to KO a weakened Breloom, hit Talonflame before it attempts to revenge kill with Brave Bird, eliminate Choice Scarf Noivern and give Cloyster useful priority before it boosts, but it is often unnecessary."}, {"Content": "The EVs are allotted in the simplest way for a sweeper, with full investment in Attack and Speed to hit as hard and fast as possible. Naughty is the preferred nature as it boosts Cloyster's Attack without detracting from Hydro Pump's power, while only lowering Cloyster's worthless Special Defense, but Adamant can be used instead if one is using Razor Shell. Naive / Jolly are options which allows Cloyster to outspeed Choice Scarf Salamence and +1 Volcarona after a Shell Smash, but Cloyster really appreciates the extra power output. There are many items viable on Cloyster, but generally Never-Melt Ice is the best option as it boosts the power of Cloyster's Icicle Spear without the debilitating recoil of Life Orb, specifically allowing Cloyster to beat Clefable, Conkeldurr, Gastrodon, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Venusaur after Stealth Rock. Lum Berry is a very helpful alternative as it offers protection from a status ailment which may be inflicted from a bulky opponent, such as Slowbro's Thunder Wave. King's Rock is a suitable item in conjunction with Skill Link as Cloyster's multi-hit moves gain a 41% flinch rate, though this is situational, and usually an item that is always in effect is better. It does have some use in breaking down bulkier checks if the flinch chance goes your way, so it is definitely helpful in certain scenarios. White Herb negates the Shell Smash drops to better shield against priority once Cloyster is weakened, while Life Orb is an acceptable choice to increase Cloyster's damage output; it enables Cloyster to do a hefty amount of damage to Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Rotom-W, but it decreases Cloyster's already short lifespan."}, {"Content": "Like all other sweepers, Cloyster cannot sweep before its counters have been removed. Take advantage of teammates such as Volcarona, Mandibuzz, and Latios; use them to eliminate troublesome Pokemon such as Aegislash, Scizor, Rotom-W, and Ferrothorn. Try to have as many entry hazards as possible on your opponent's side, as this will aid Cloyster's sweep immensely. In order to set up, Cloyster should come in on something it forces out, or something that can't do much to it, and then use Shell Smash. Often it may seem tempting to lead with Cloyster and Shell Smash straight away, but try to avoid this is your opponent may have a counter that you are unprepared for. Also, with Cloyster's low Special Defense, it may not always find opportunities to set up, so make sure you take advantage of the moves your opponent makes to find a suitable moment. One thing to note is that because of the large threat Cloyster immediately poses, it often baits opponents to use an array of attacks from the get-go, and this can be used to your advantage by pivot switching into something that can take the hit and force the foe out, and then switching back to Cloyster."}, {"Content": "In terms of teammates, Cloyster mainly appreciates powerful special attackers that can take on the variety of foes that it can't itself. An excellent example of this would be Volcarona, who can take on the likes of Scizor, Breloom, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Aegislash before they have the chance to threaten Cloyster. Other Pokemon that perform similarly in this role include Latios with Hidden Power Fire, Rotom-H, and Heatran. Landorus-T and Mandibuzz can get rid of Cloyster's main counter, Aegislash and Mandibuzz in particular can use Foul Play on many physical priority users which trouble Cloyster. Cloyster always enjoys hazard support from the likes of Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory. Additionally, Cloyster enjoys hazard support on its own side as well, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to all other hazards; this can be in the form of either Rapid Spinners or Defoggers, and examples include Excadrill, Scizor, Mandibuzz, Latias, Starmie and Forretress (who can also set up hazards making it an excellent partner). Because Mandibuzz can fill both the role of a Defog user and a counter to Aegislash, it is a fantastic partner to Cloyster. Magnezone can trap and eliminate many of the Steel-types which threaten Cloyster, such as Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn. Cloyster also likes dual screen support as it gives it fantastic support while it is setting up. Aegislash can run Hidden Power Fire to act as a lure for the aforementioned Steel-types, as well as use the advantages of King's Shield to give Cloyster free switch-ins."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation":

Rotom-H is a fantastic partner for Raikou because it is immune to Ground-type moves courtesy of its Levitate ability. It can also burn Pokemon to cushion physical attacks for Raikou as well as damage them with Hidden Power Grass. In addition, Grass-types such as Shaymin make excellent partners because they can get rid of problematic Pokemon like Gastrodon and Swampert that would otherwise stop Raikou right in its tracks. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Roserade, Smeargle, and Gligar is vital for allowing Raikou to secure KOs that it wouldn't normally get."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "",

Make sure that the rain is alway up when you bring Ludicolo in: if it means sacrificing your Politoed to get the rain up so be it.

Rotom-Wash is capable of dealing with Talonflame effectively without messing up Ludicolo's rain, making it a valuable asset on any team that features it. Rapid Spin users, most notably Tentacruel due to Rain Dish and its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes upon switch-in, are able to deal with Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes, both of which plague Ludicolo due to the fact that they limit Ludicolo's sweeping capabilities and wear it down quickly, respectively. On the subject of Toxic Spikes, anything with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy to get rid of paralysis, burn or poison from Ludicolo is an excelent teammate as Ludicolo hates all three of these statuses.

Hydro Pump is the most powerful special attack that Greninja can opt to run outside of Hyper Beam, benefits from great coverage, and should be used against bulkier targets in general. Ice Beam is essential for this set, as it provides coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types, and also operates as Greninja's main \"STAB\" move if Hydro Pump's inaccuracy is too risky. Extrasensory is nearly a requirement, as it allows Greninja to heavily damage Mega Venusaur and Keldeo, two of the most common defensive and offensive threats in the metagame, respectively. It also hits several other important counters, including Tentacruel and Conkeldurr."}, {"Content": "The rest of the set comes down to preference.

The flinch chance may also occasionally come in handy against both of them. Hidden Power Grass can be run to hit opposing Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types hard, but is mainly used to hit popular bulky targets such as Rotom-W and Gastrodon. It should also be noted that using Hidden Power Grass will turn Greninja Grass-type, allowing it to take on Rotom-W's attacks more easily. Hidden Power Fire can be used to reliably hit a smaller, but equally important list of targets, especially Ferrothorn, specially defensive Scizor, and Forretress."}, {"Content": "Grass Knot can be used instead of Hidden Power Grass, but differs somewhat in its targets.

Due to its frailty, Greninja should typically be sent in via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, or after a teammate has fainted."}, {"Content": "As a word of caution, do not overestimate Greninja's capabilities. Even with Protean boosting its attacks, Greninja cannot OHKO many bulky opponents, such as Charizard-X, Charizard-Y, Aegislash, Latias, and Togekiss at full heath, giving many of them opportunities to tank a hit and retaliate. Greninja should not switch into such Pokemon, or if it is up against them, it should retreat and allow another Pokemon to either handle the threat or weaken it so it can be KOed later on. Additionally, do not attempt to wall Pokemon or tank resisted hits with the help of Protean, as Greninja is very frail and additional damage along with Life Orb recoil will quickly bring it down.

It is also Gothitelle's most powerful move, making it a decent choice against most threats that don't resist Psychic. Both have their own benefits: Psyshock OHKOes Assault Vest Conkeldurr and does more damage to special walls such as Blissey, Sylveon, and Goodra, while Psychic can OHKO Mega Venusaur cleanly with prior damage, and is generally more powerful. Thunderbolt's primary targets are Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Gyarados, but it also a great option for the likes of Togekiss, Azumarill, and Politoed. Hidden Power Fire is used mainly to hit Ferrothorn and (Mega) Scizor, and is guaranteed to OHKO physically defensive variants of both with Stealth Rock damage. Energy Ball is an alternative option to hit Quagsire, Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Rotom-W, all of which also tend to be important parts of defensive cores. Grass Knot can take Energy Ball's place for a guaranteed OHKO on Hippowdon as well as a harder hit on Tyranitar, but it does pittance to Rotom-W due to its low weight. Trick is the icing on the cake, allowing Gothitelle to instantly and severely cripple defensive tanks and walls, such as Chansey, Clefable, Porygon2, and Snorlax. It should be noted that unlike other Trick users, Gothitelle can be selective in targets it can use Trick on, so it doesn't have to worry about Pokemon with Mega Stones switching in."}, {"Content": "Gothitelle isn't necessarily limited to the moves listed above; you can choose other moves and tailor your moveset depending on which threats your team has trouble with. Hidden Power Ice is an option for instantly OHKOing Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, though Gothitelle might have trouble switching into these three for various reasons. Hidden Power Ground is used specifically for Heatran, but can also put a decent dent in Tyranitar and Bisharp when needed. Notably, when running a combination of Hidden Power Ground, Psychic, and Trick, Gothitelle can defeat and cripple the common stall core of Mega Venusaur, Heatran, and Chansey."}, {"Content": "The item of choice for this set, of course, is Choice Specs, which gives Gothitelle the power to break through defensive cores and Pokemon. With Trick, it also operates as a nasty afterthought to item-reliant walls and tanks. While Gothitelle isn't exactly fast enough to outrun a majority of threats, maximized Special Attack and Speed are recommended so it stands a better chance of beating opponents that typically don't invest in their Speed, especially (Mega) Scizor, Rotom-W, Heatran, Mega Venusaur and Landorus-T. Modest nature is also recommended as Gothitelle requires the extra power and doesn't outrun anything particularly relevant with Timid aside from max Speed Adamant Breloom and Bisharp."}, {"Content": "Alternatively, Gothitelle can invest in its bulk to better take hits at the cost of a higher chance of beating several faster threats. In this case, an EV spread of 212 HP / 252 SpA / 44 Spe can be used to outspeed minimum Speed Skarmory and Politoed while investing the rest of the EVs in HP for extra bulk."}, {"Content": "The main goal of this set is to trap and eliminate Pokemon in defensive cores to allow a sweeper to sweep after they have been removed. Notably, Gothitelle performs exceptionally well against stall teams, as it can cripple and dismantle multiple defensive Pokemon repeatedly without taking too much damage. As long as you can keep Gothitelle from taking too much chip damage, expect it to take down at least a couple of threats on stall teams. Playing with Gothitelle doesn't require much prediction, as the foe can't switch out. However, bear in mind that the opponent may be able to take advantage of the move at you will be locked into. To trap and KO successfully, Gothitelle must be at a reasonable level of health, especially when operating against hard-hitting or faster opponents. A good way to do this is by means of U-turn and Volt Switch, or after one of your Pokemon has fainted. Bringing it in on attacks is not recommended, especially physical or boosted ones, unless resisted."}, {"Content": "Gothitelle itself has good, but modest, overall bulk, so it can afford to take hits on both sides occasionally. The sight of Gothitelle in team preview could also lead the opponent to making strange double switches to avoid being trapped. This is easy to take advantage of, but be aware that you can also fall victim to bad switches. Also, trapping anything while the other team has a Pursuit user such as Bisharp or Aegislash is not recommended, as they will be able to KO Gothitelle back straightaway. The exception to this is if the Pokemon in your way is a huge threat to your team, and after it is gone things will be significantly easier for your win condition, so Gothitelle is not as necessary after it has taken down its important foe."}, {"Content": "Keep in mind that Gothitelle is purely a supporting attacker, so it doesn't actually need much support on its own. However, Gothitelle prefers switching in on its targets cleanly, making Volt Switch and U-turn very helpful, if not required. Examples of teammates that can use these moves include (Mega) Scizor, Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Thundurus, all of which have counters that can be immediately eliminated by Gothitelle. Rapid Spin and Defog are also helpful in ensuring Gothitelle can switch in cleanly, although keep in mind that when using Defog your own sweepers might require previously-set entry hazards. Latios, Latias, and Excadrill are good choices for this. Sticky Web is also optimal, as it allows Gothitelle to trap and KO a wider range of threats more efficiently without taking too much damage in the process. Shuckle and Smeargle are good choices for this, but perform differently from each other, so the choice is dependent on your team."}, {"Content": "Many offensive Pokemon in particular benefit from Gothitelle's trapping abilities. For instance, Thundurus often has trouble with Chansey, Hippowdon, and Quagsire depending on which set it's using; all three are easy pickings for Gothitelle thanks to Trick and its chosen Grass-type move. Gothitelle is also efficient at getting rid of Mega Venusaur, so Tail Glow Manaphy not only appreciates Gothitelle as a teammate, but also gains the freedom to use Energy Ball rather than Psychic. Gothitelle can also dismantle Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Skarmory easily, allowing it to work well with physical setup sweepers. Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar, Swords Dance Mega Pinsir, and Swords Dance Bisharp are just a few of many exceptional physical sweepers that perform well after said walls are eliminated. Finally, Gothitelle appreciates teammates that can threaten or set up on Pursuit users after it faints. Terrakion, Keldeo, and Greninja are just a few examples of threats that can match up decently against common Pursuit users."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Choice Specs"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 252, "HP": 0, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 4, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [15], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Psychic", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Psyshock", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Thunderbolt", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Energy Ball", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Hidden Power Fire", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Trick", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Choice Specs"}, {"Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Shadow Tag"}], "Description": [{"Content": "Psychic gets the 2HKO on mega scizor at +6 and is stronger in general"}, {"Content": "Psyshock helps with Ho-Oh and lets Gothitelle setup alongside and beat CM Arceus formes more often than not"}, {"Content": "Calm Mind allows Gothitelle to setup on weaker, specially attacking Pokmon like support Arceus formes"}, {"Content": "Rest shrugs off status and lets Gothitelle gather extra boosts"}, {"Content": "Trick Room lets Gothitelle take advantage of its mediocre speed to sweep after capping its stats"}, {"Content": "Taunt harrasses walls a lot more and can help if your team is weak to spike setters like Skarmory"}, {"Content": "Heal Bell can be used to support your team in a status heavy metagame like Ubers"}, {"Content": "Magic Coat can be used to surprise Taunt users and hazard setters"}, {"Content": "Torment can help it setup easier by stopping support Arceus and other single attacking pokemon from attacking multiple times in a row or using Calm Mind alongside Gothitelle"}, {"Content": "Maximum special bulk eases setup and lets goth setup safely on more targets like Palkia or Scarf Xerneas if Goth can come in for free somewhere (usually after a kill)"}, {"Content": "If using Trick Room, running as little speed is possible so that you can move first versus as many things as possible when Trick Room is active"}, {"Content": "If using Taunt, opt for a Calm nature, instead, and use 44 speed evs to outrun Skarmory so that you can Taunt it before it can Taunt or use hazards"}, {"Content": "If you want to move some of that spdef evs elsewhere, you can opt to run only 40 spdef evs with a calm or sassy nature with the leftover being poured into the stat of your choice.

Whirlwind is primarily for when the opponent attempts to boost up; however, it also has great utility in letting Skarmory scout its switch-ins and rack up entry hazard damage by shuffling the opponent's Pokemon. Stealth Rock is a great option for the third slot; thanks to its great physical bulk and resilience, Skarmory finds no trouble setting Stealth Rock up at many points within a battle. Defog allows Skarmory to clear the field of entry hazards to make the battlefield more welcoming for hazard-susceptible teammates. However, Brave Bird is also a viable option over either Stealth Rock or Defog according to the team's needs, as it gives Skarmory a moderately strong STAB attack that threatens some of its frailer switch-ins, a way to pick off opponents weakened by its entry hazards, and something to prevent it from being Taunt bait. Spikes can be used in place of Stealth Rock should the team already have a reliable user of Stealth Rock, as Skarmory is an effective Spiker. However, because Spikes is counterproductive to the use of Defog and redundant with Stealth Rock, it should always be run alongside Brave Bird. Finally, Taunt can be run as a way to prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up alongside it, particularly defensive ones."}, {"Content": "This is Skarmory's standard set, as it lets Skarmory most effectively use its great Defense stat. Skarmory runs full HP and Defense EVs to maximize its physical bulk, its most valuable statistical trait. If taking advantage of Sturdy is absolutely necessary, a spread of 224 HP / 252 Def / 32 SpD can be used so Skarmory recovers exactly enough HP to reactivate Sturdy two turns after switching into Stealth Rock. However, this is not only extremely situational but also implies a waste of Skarmory's potential, as the only attacks that bring it down to Sturdy are powerful special attacks, which it should not be attempting to tank. An Impish nature should be used alongside Brave Bird; however, if this is not the case, a Bold nature should be used, as it lessens the damage taken from Foul Play and confusion. Because Skarmory is a defensive Pokemon, Leftovers is an ideal item, increasing its survivability alongside Roost. However, due to Skarmory's role as a physical wall, Rocky Helmet is also a great item, as it quickly wears down the physical attackers Skarmory switches into. Shed Shell is another possibility, allowing Skarmory to escape the clutches of Magnezone and Gothitelle, but this is extremely situational, albeit useful."}, {"Content": "Skarmory usually enters the battle as a counter to physical attackers such as Mega Pinsir, although it can come in on other defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Blissey. Roost should be used liberally, to restore Skarmory to full health, as this lets it avoid 2HKOs from some of the stronger attackers in the tier. As a general rule, when in doubt, use Whirlwind. Not only is it a great scouting move, but it also gets you out of unexpected situations, such as when facing Garchomp or Tyranitar sets that utilize Fire Blast. Defog should be used whenever entry hazards may threaten the other members of your team. Furthermore, Skarmory can follow up Defog with Stealth Rock, essentially keeping the battle in your favor in a short span of two turns. Although entry hazards are great to have set up as soon as possible, they should not be your number one priority, as Skarmory's longevity is usually far more important. Skarmory can't stay in on powerful special attackers such as Latios, so switch out to a teammate when possible to avoid taking major damage. Taunt and Brave Bird, with a bit of prediction, can be used to force out or wear down counters, respectively, when used on the switch.

Blissey and Chansey work particularly well in tandem with Skarmory, as their respective defensive stats function well together against almost any attacker not using a mixed set. Although they need additional team support, specially defensive variants of Jellicent and Heatran also work well, as both can stop many of the Fire-type attackers that try to break through Skarmory. Teammates resistant or immune to Electric-type moves are appreciated as well. Celebi in particular stands out in this role, as it hard-counters Rotom-W, one of Skarmory's most common switch-ins. If Skarmory is being used on a team largely dependent on entry hazards, a spinblocker can be useful as well, although it will not stop users of Defog. If Skarmory is being used as part of a defensive core on a balanced team, offensive teammates that value the effect of entry hazards and the ability to easily fall back on a defensive wall when forced out will appreciate Skarmory's presence.

Stealth Rock is a great choice for specially defensive Skarmory, as its great defensive typing and decent mixed bulk let it set up Stealth Rock against a wide range of opponents. If either Stealth Rock or Defog is not necessary, Brave Bird gives Skarmory a way to inflict immediate damage on opposing Pokemon and prevents it from being Taunt bait.

However, remember to use Defog before Stealth Rock if necessary, as Defog will also remove the hazards you set. Whirlwind is also a great choice to use on a free turn, particularly if the opponent's Skarmory counter is weak to hazards, and should also be used liberally against well-known boosting threats such as Dragonite and Lucario to prevent any sort of setup. However, remember that Roost is the best choice should Skarmory risk getting low on health, as it can only continue to function as a wall if its HP is high. If a Magic Bounce user such as Espeon is on the opponent's team, it's often not a bad idea to go straight for Brave Bird, as both Espeon and Mega Absol will be lured in and take significant damage from a well-timed attack, although Xatu will be able to heal it off with Roost."}, {"Content": "This Skarmory set is much more standalone than physically defensive variants, sacrificing some of its walling potential for the ability to stand up against a wider array of threats.

Note that Whirlwind is sometimes the best choice even if full hazards have not been set up, as many potential switch-ins to Skarmory, such as Mega Charizard Y, will take substantial damage from Stealth Rock alone. Roost should be used whenever necessary to keep Skarmory healthy, as some of the stronger physical attackers in the tier, such as Conkeldurr with Guts activated, can catch Skarmory at somewhat low health and take it out.

Skarmory has a huge reliance on entry hazards, so a spinblocker can be useful. Trevenant is a great choice, as it matches up well against the most common spinner, Excadrill, and can force numerous switches of its own. Prankster Taunt users such as Thundurus and Sableye can be major hindrances to this set, so having a Pokemon that can deal with them, such as Clefable or Assault Vest Conkeldurr, is very beneficial. Finally, due to the shuffling effect of Whirlwind and the entry hazards that are set up, this variant of Skarmory tends to leave the opponent's team in a heavily weakened state.

Taunt is best to pressure other hazard setters and Defog users on the switch-in if it should run hazards. Defog allows Skarmory to remove dangerous hazards such as Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes, which is good, as it is immune to both.

However, what it loses in special bulk, it makes up for in massive physical bulk which rivals that of Groudon. It is often a great answer to bulky Ground types such as Landorus-Therian, Groudon and Hippowdon, easily Defogging, Taunting or setting hazards versus them. No other Steel type barring the uncommon Bronzong can accomplish this, and this is one of Skarmory's biggest niches over a Pokemon such as Mega-Scizor. There is not much else to say about Skarmory--play it to its strengths and it will not disappoint, but misuse it and it will faint far too fast to check anything that it needs to."}, {"Content": "Due to its being forced out by some physical attackers and Zekrom unlike most Steel-types, Skarmory can be difficult to build around.

A non-steel type Xerneas check is also borderline mandatory to avoid overlap, so Ho-oh, Specially Defensive Roar Xerneas and Specially Defensive Kyogre can all make good teammates. Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Landorus-Therian are all appreciated for taking on Zekrom, Ho-oh, and Mega-Blaziken to some extent, as these things massively threaten Skarmory. Arceus-Water, especially its Calm Mind variant makes a good teammate due to its ability to beat Kyogre, Ho-oh, Palkia, and Mega-Blaziken for it, while Skarmory can compensate for the lack of a support Arceus by providing Defog and checking opposing Swords Dance Arceus. Arceus-Electric is in a similar boat, but it trades the ability to easily take on Mega-Blaziken for the ability to sponge Electric attacks for Skarmory and force out opposing Ho-Oh. Chople Berry Tyranitar is acceptable as a teammate, as it can pursuit-trap Mega-Gengar while Skarmory walls Hippowdon and Groudon for it, assuming the latter lacks a Fire move.

Double Edge has the same power as Brave Bird, but it is resisted by more common types and fails to touch another due to their immunity, so it should be used sparingly, as Brave Bird is most often the better choice. Close Combat is another situational move, and its main targets are Heatran and Tyranitar. Nearly every Pokemon that Close Combat hits is 2HKOed by Brave Bird, so predicting switch-ins is usually unnecessary. U-turn should only be used in specific situations, as Staraptor rarely gets a chance to safely switch in and attack, so making the most of these few opportunities is important in order to use it to its full potential. Final Gambit is great for crippling Skarmory, Staraptor's most reliable defensive check, and allows another Pokemon to come in for free. Quick Attack is an option to revenge kill severely weakened faster threats, but it is a horrible move to be locked into and Staraptor is better off leaving revenge killing duties to another Pokemon such as Talonflame."}, {"Content": "Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are invested because, as a frail offensive Pokemon, Staraptor's main purpose should be to hit things hard and fast. Staraptor needs as much Speed as possible as it cannot afford to be outsped in most cases, so a Jolly nature is preferred. The extra power of an Adamant nature doesn't help it attain many more notable KOs, but the Speed drop means that Staraptor will be outsped by a ton of important Pokemon from around base 90 Speed and up. However, an Adamant nature can still be used to get a few OHKOs and 2HKOs that Jolly cannot. The most significant of these are the 2HKOs on Heatran and Rotom-W after Stealth Rock with Brave Bird and the OHKOs on them with Close Combat and Double Edge, respectively. Choice Band is the perfect item for Staraptor, as the 1.5x boost to its Attack makes it much more threatening. Furthermore, it only uses Brave Bird in most situations so there's no real need for it to be able to switch moves."}, {"Content": "Click Brave Bird and watch things faint. There's no secret to using Staraptor; Brave Bird is the best attack in almost every circumstance. Double Edge and Close Combat should only be used to hit specific Pokemon that resist Brave Bird, such as Rotom-W and Tyranitar, respectively. U-turn should usually only be used if the opponent has an Aegislash or Skarmory, but it can be useful early on if there's a specific wall you want to save Staraptor for. Staraptor is so frail that it cannot comfortably switch into even resisted attacks, so when it does get in, it should be used to deal as much damage as possible before going down, as it may not get many more chances to come in."}, {"Content": "Talonflame is by far Staraptor's best partner.

Excadrill can provide much needed Rapid Spin support and set up Stealth Rock, which turns a few 2HKOs into OHKOs, most notably against Heatran and Rotom-W. Defog support from the likes of Latios, Scizor, or Latias is also useful in removing Stealth Rock from the playing field. Latias also has Healing Wish, which can give Staraptor or one of its allies a second chance to tear through the opposing team.

Choice Scarf Staraptor should usually be saved for late in the game and then brought in when it has a good opportunity to clean.

Keeping Trevenant healthy is of utmost importance if an opposing spinner is present, so it should focus on keeping its health high before aiming to cripple its opponents. Keep Trevenant away from status and Pursuit users (as Trevenant no longer outspeeds the latter), as they will greatly limit this set's capacity to function due to Trevenant incurring too much damage. Keep in mind though that this set is mainly equipped to deal with Starmie and Mega Blastoise while doing only decently against Excadrill without Swords Dance, but if you have greater troubles with Excadrill, you should probably try Gourgeist instead."}, {"Content": "Hazard setters provide residual damage that Trevenant can stack with its own, while Trevenant's Ghost typing stops Rapid Spin from getting rid of the hazards. Tyranitar is the most obvious teammate, as it not only possesses Stealth Rock but also offers great defensive synergy with Trevenant; on rare occasions, Trevenant can even make use of sand to inch itself into Sitrus range to gain more net health. Spikes users are a tad harder to choose from as most, such as Skarmory and Forretress, share weaknesses with Trevenant, most notably to Fire. Greninja and Klefki have decent defensive synergy with Trevenant, though the former is frail; Trevenant, in turn, takes Ground-type attacks for Klefki or Electric-, Grass-, and Fighting-type moves for Greninja. Tentacruel and Greninja both have Toxic Spikes, but note that they can interfere with Trevenant's use of Will-O-Wisp. Note also that Trevenant cannot take on Swords Dance Excadrill with Iron Head or Shadow Claw, so fast powerful sweepers that can switch into those moves, such as Greninja and Charizard, are good partners as they can threaten Excadrill before it gets to spin. A backup plan against Starmie and Mega Blastoise is also advised in case they break through with high damage rolls or their moves' secondary effects; fast Electric-types such as Thundurus and Choice Scarf Rotom-W can dispatch them before they get the chance to spin, and can make use of the prevailing hazards with Volt Switch. Lucario can even activate Justified via Mega Blastoise's Dark Pulse and then Mega Evolve to OHKO with +1 Adaptability Close Combat. Defog throws a wrench in the spinblocking plan, so Pokemon that can dispatch of the most common Defog users are exceptional partners.

The next move prevents Trevenant from being taken advantage of easily by those that resist Grass-type attacks.

A specially defensive spread is also viable for handling Water- and Electric-type threats more easily, but the physical attackers that Trevenant checks are more common and can overwhelm Trevenant more readily if it cannot adequately respond to them. Leftovers offers good passive healing for Trevenant and increases its survivability, or at the very least means it will not be forced to Rest nearly as often; alternatively, the combination of Lum Berry and Harvest allows Trevenant to stay in after using Rest instead of being forced out, but is reliant on its Berry being regenerated, which might not always happen immediately, to keep itself status-free."}, {"Content": "This variant of Trevenant does not care much about status at all, most notably enabling it to switch into Scald without worry, as well as allowing it to soak up other problematic status effects and shrug them right off.

It can switch into status moves or one of the many attacks it resists, and start spreading burns or smacking opponents with its attacks, which can even be used to catch certain switch-ins for unexpectedly large damage.

Trevenant has issues against the Fire-type opponents it cannot burn, making Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types good partners, while also boasting helpful defensive synergy with Trevenant. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Sylveon and Goodra appreciate facing burned opponents as it means their defenses are harder to pierce, which allows them to stick around on the battlefield for longer.

Seed Flare does good damage with Life Orb, and of course, nothing likes switching into it in fear of a Special Defense drop. Earth Power is actually Shaymin-S's main resource for defeating Steel-types which wall its STAB combination, and can also cause a 20% chance to lower the opponent's Special Defense as well. Instead of Earth Power, Hidden Power Fire can let Shaymin-S defeat the Steel-types that don't care too much about Earth Power like Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Scizor. But, Healing Wish is actually a support move that Shaymin-S can claim its own outside of Latias, and if Shaymin-S is either not useful or cannot deal enough damage due to attacks or Life Orb recoil, it can simply sacrifice itself to restore a damaged sweeper, pivot, or revenge killer to full health. Though not listed here, Hidden Power Rock allows Shaymin-S to take on or kill Ho-Oh, and can damage other Flying-types outside of Ho-Oh reliably due to the Life Orb boost."}, {"Content": "A Timid nature lets Shaymin-S outspeed most of the unboosted tier easily, and with Life Orb, the damage is very acceptable, even more so than a unboosted Modest nature. However, if you do want that extra 10% in terms of damage, a Modest nature can certainly fit the bill, but once again keep in mind that you cannot outspeed max Speed Arceus formes or Darkrai anymore. In terms of EVs, Shaymin-S should not deviate from the above spread, as its Speed and power are all too precious to give up instead of its below-average bulk."}, {"Content": "When attempting to select moves when attacking, don't be too afraid to mispredict with your STABs, as they are extremely spammable, and they are backed up with Life Orb, so don't be too afraid to click Seed Flare unless a Steel-type that checks you is on the opposing team. But, be very wary of the recoil that you get from Life Orb, as your health could reduce to the point where a priority user like Yveltal, Scizor, or Extreme Killer Arceus can come in and revenge kill you with ease. Therefore, you should try to avoid priority users as much as possible, as Shaymin-S's frailty combined with Life Orb recoil can turn it into a high-priority target."}, {"Content": "As always for any offensive threat, hazards on the opponent's side of the field can take advantage of Shaymin-S's offensive pressure and rack up residual damage.

Also, hazard removal methods are important, so Defoggers like Arceus and Giratina, and Spinners like Forretress and Excadrill can remove these without a fuss. Even with Earth Power or Hidden Power Fire, Shaymin-S should have extra support against Steel-types. So, Fire-types like Ho-Oh or stallbreakers like Yveltal or even Darkrai can assist Shaymin-S in this case. VoltTurn is still a safe method to bring Shaymin-S in, and Thundurus-I and Genesect can provide momentum to do so and supply their team members with extra utility.

Also, try using Substitute to scout out super effective coverage moves, and try to use it before Leech Seed, as you can get it up safely without being damaged. But, when using the two, try using Substitute if you feel if an offensive threat is coming in so you can scout out their set, or Leech Seed if you think a defensive Pokemon or phazer is coming in so you can get residual damage against them. In lines of attacking, Shaymin-S's STAB combos may not have too good coverage, but they are very threatening or spammable, so fire away when needed.

The primary ones are VoltTurn users, who can gain momentum and bring Shaymin-S in on a fleeing opponent.

Though Mega Gengar helps many, it can also trap Steel-types and cripple them with Taunt, leaving them open to Shaymin-S's shenanigans. Yveltal is also a solid friend, as it pretty much borks most of the Steel-types in Ubers, and can assist Shaymin-S with Taunt or U-turn. Heatran is a very helpful partner as it can lure Ground-types for Shaymin-S to switch in on a predicted Ground-type move and proceed to set up, and Heatran can also set up Stealth Rocks. Hazard setters like Forretress, Ferrothorn, Dialga, and Landorus-T are also crucial to Shaymin-S's success as Stealth Rock and / or Spikes can let it finish off or defeat support Arceus and Ho-Oh. Hazard removal is equally important, as Shaymin-S wants to switch in as much as it can, so Defog users like Arceus and Giratina or Rapid Spinners like Excadrill and Forretress can help out in this regard, and the latter 3 do enjoy Leech Seed to increase recovery and longevity."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Leftovers"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 252, "HP":

Garchomp's vulnerability to Will-O-Wisp makes it a wise idea to switch out from a Will-O-Wisp user that it cannot OHKO or immediately use Substitute if the Will-O-Wisp user is slower.

However, if you would rather have Garchomp clean up the foe's team later in the the game, Swords Dance is the recommended option over Draco Meteor to bolster Garchomp's attack power. Stone Edge and Rock Slide are both used to defeat Flying-types immune to Garchomp's STAB Earthquake. Stone Edge is the recommended choice if using Draco Meteor, as the combination of a -1 Stone Edge and Draco Meteor is able to KO Landorus-T. Rock Slide, on the other hand, is the better choice if using Swords Dance, as its spread effect is more useful than Stone Edge's greater power in this scenario. Finally, Protect is used in the fourth slot, as it allows Garchomp to scout for super effective coverage attacks, status moves, and Fake Out."}, {"Content": "Garchompite is the only viable item on this set, as it allows Garchomp to run special attacks such as Draco Meteor and take advantage of Sandstorm more efficiently. Fire Blast can be used on this set, as it hits Bronzong and bulky Grass-types such as Trevenant for super effective damage, but it has little use beyond this. An Adamant or Naughty nature can be used if speed Control is provided. However, the ability to outspeed threats such as Jolly Landorus-T, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Charizard Y if Garchomp has not Mega-Evolved is rarely worth passing up for a small amount of extra power."}, {"Content": "Swords Dance variations of Mega Garchomp are better used late-game to clean up the foe's team with its high-powered spread attacks. Draco Meteor variations of Garchomp are better used early-game to lure and defeat its common checks such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W, making it easier for Pokemon such as Swords Dance Scizor and Choice Scarf Tyranitar to clean up the foe's team later in the match. Although this set does better against Will-O-Wisp users, Garchomp should still switch out in such a matchup, as Garchomp does not like taking residual damage and having its main STAB move weakened."}, {"Content": "It should be noted that Garchomp does not have to Mega Evolve immediately, as regular Garchomp's higher speed is more useful than Mega Garchomp's increased power against some specific threats such as Salamence, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Charizard Y."}, {"Content": "Tyranitar is a mandatory partner for this set, as the Sandstorm it provides bolsters Mega Garchomp's power to incredible levels due to Mega Garchomp's ability, Sand Force. Tyranitar can also defeat Flying-types such as Togekiss with Rock Slide and can put Cresselia in a checkmate position with Crunch. In return, Garchomp is able to defeat Steel-types that genuinely give Tyranitar trouble, such as Bisharp, non-Wide Guard Aegislash, and Heatran. Garchomp also enjoys any form of speed control, even more so than the previous set due to Mega Garchomp's lowered Speed stat. Good partners that can provide Garchomp with speed control include Cresselia, Togekiss, Zapdos, and Jirachi. Steel-types such as Genesect, Scizor, and Bisharp are also great partners, as they have nearly flawless defensive synergy with Garchomp, can defeat Cresselia with their secondary STAB moves, and are able to defeat Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-types that Garchomp dislikes facing.

Outrage has greater power than Earthquake and hits Pokemon immune and resistant to Earthquake, such as Rotom-W and Landorus-T. However, it comes with the disadvantage of locking Garchomp into the move for two to three turns. If getting locked into the move is not preferred, Dragon Claw is an equally viable alternative.

Outside of the items listed, a Yache Berry can be used to weaken revenge killing attempts from the likes of Keldeo and Thundurus.

This means that you should generally try to deal with Pokemon such as Skarmory and Bronzong before you try to set up Swords Dance so that Garchomp's sweeping attempt doesn't instantly fail. Because Garchomp can force switches quite easily, Swords Dance is best used on a predicted switch or when the Pokemon it is facing can do little to prevent a sweep. Examples of Pokemon that Garchomp can attempt to set up on include Chansey, Excadrill, and some variants of Tyranitar. Keep in mind that setting up a Swords Dance is a lot easier when Garchomp has a Lum Berry, as it gives it the ability to use Swords Dance on Pokemon such as Rotom-W, which would otherwise burn it.

It is especially useful against Steel-type Pokemon, such as Mawile and Aegislash, which are immune to Toxic or don't mind Dragon Tail. Garchomp's second attack, Dragon Tail, is used to phaze opponents and help rack up damage from entry hazards. This means that most Pokemon cannot easily set up when facing Garchomp.

With a Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin, passive damage can rack up fairly quickly. Keep in mind, however, that despite the defensive investment, Garchomp is by no means a wall and should not be used to combat setup sweepers, merely to punish lighter physical attackers.

Combined with Destiny Bond, it also helps Mega Gengar sacrifice itself to eliminate numerous Pokemon that it otherwise could not, as bulky attackers often threaten it more than it can threaten them. Its attacking moves allow it to annihilate many Pokemon that they hit super effectively and overpower defensive Pokemon that cannot threaten it.

Substitute also works really well with Disable; even against Pokemon that can take Gengar out with multiple attacks, it blocks status moves as well as Sucker Punch, giving Gengar a free turn to dish out damage. Shadow Ball is Gengar's STAB move of choice, as its neutral coverage is unrivaled and it does pretty solid damage to most Pokemon, letting Gengar keep up the offensive pressure. Will-O-Wisp is a fantastic move in general, and on Gengar it is very valuable for pressuring defensive Pokemon, as well as severely crippling typical checks and counters, especially Pursuit, Shadow Sneak, and Sucker Punch users.

Sludge Wave provides reasonably good coverage with Shadow Ball and also lets Gengar act as a potent Fairy-type slayer. Disable prevents the opposing Pokemon from using the move they last used for three turns, allowing Gengar to prey upon opposing Pokemon that rely on one move to do significant damage to it, as well as completely shutting down slower Choice attackers. Dropping Will-O-Wisp decreases Gengar's effectiveness against offensive teams, but Taunt and Disable in tandem are a nightmare to stall-based teams, preventing the opponent from healing or clearing entry hazards while also completely shutting down mono-attacking sets that many stall Pokemon use."}, {"Content": "An alternative option in the last slot is Focus Blast, which provides perfect neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball and lets Gengar patch up a weakness to Dark-types that attempt to beat it with Sucker Punch or Pursuit, or by virtue of their typing in general.

If your team values Gengar to the point where sacrificing it is unacceptable, Focus Blast should be used."}, {"Content": "Black Sludge goes excellently with a set that ought to be creating a fair amount of free turns, and it is necessary for Substitute to be as effective as possible. An EV spread of 28 HP / 148 SpA / 80 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature lets Gengar's Substitutes survive a minimum Special Attack Mega Venusaur's Giga Drain or Clefable's Moonblast, allowing Gengar to deal with these common threats much more easily. If this is not a massive concern, a simple spread with maximum Speed and Special Attack investment improves offensive capability while still being very effective against defense."}, {"Content": "Gengar's unpredictability means that a number of moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Taunt will often be a surprise. This lets Gengar act as a solid Taunt lead, as even Magic Coat users will falter. If you see opposing Smeargle or Deoxys-D, leading with Gengar is recommended. Against stall teams, Gengar is quite effective as it easily makes free Substitutes on stall staples such as Chansey, Hippowdon, Clefable, and Gliscor. This success is exponentially greater with entry hazards, as it often forces the opponent to switch around. Against stall teams, aggressive Stealth Rock use and getting Gengar into the fray is recommended."}, {"Content": "Against more offensive teams, Gengar isn't as great; however, its Speed can still be useful, so Ghost-weak Pokemon slower than Gengar can be easily checked, and Gengar's fast Will-O-Wisp can also be used to shut down slower attackers if necessary. Subsitute + Disable preys well upon opponents that have little to hit Gengar with outside of one coverage move, so scouting for sets with teammates or excessive Substitute use may be helpful. Disable prevents slower Choice attackers from doing anything at all, and again, scouting for these is valuable as it can buy Gengar free turns. Ferrothorn is easy prey for the Substitute + Disable set as it relies on just one attacking move to beat Gengar. If given a free turn behind a Substitute against a full-strength Aegislash, it is generally advisable to burn it; although Shadow Ball deals a lot of damage to Aegislash, Gengar will be forced out due to the threat of Shadow Sneak the next turn, so Will-O-Wisp is the better option to let Gengar do more damage one-on-one and make Aegislash much easier to deal with later in the match."}, {"Content": "When not using Focus Blast, a strong Fighting- or Fairy-type partner to beat Dark-types that make life a pain for Gengar is appreciated. Azumarill, Terrakion, and Keldeo are good choices for this in general. Gengar switches in to its immunities the best, so powerful attackers such as Life Orb Terrakion that put sufficient pressure on the opponent to use Fighting-, Normal-, or Ground-type moves despite Gengar's presence go well with it. Due to the fact that Gengar can effectively render opponents unable to damage it with Disable or Taunt and Substitute, it often forces the opponent to switch. As such, entry hazard stacking racks up damage very efficiently. Entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S, Deoxys-D, Terrakion, Garchomp, or Landorus make great teammates as they can also indirectly punch holes in an opposing team. As damage from entry hazards accumulates, opponents may attempt to remove them. Opponents cannot Rapid Spin on Gengar to remove entry hazards thanks to its Ghost typing, but they may be able to use Defog if Gengar lacks Taunt. Bisharp is a solid partner to Gengar in this regard, as it can deter opponents from using Defog thanks to Defiant and can act as solid answer to the ever-present Aegislash, which can check Gengar by threatening with Shadow Sneak. This set is very good at stallbreaking when using Taunt, so insert it on teams that may struggle against this team archetype. The few viable stall Pokemon that can actually defeat Gengar such as specially defensive Heatran and Knock Off Gliscor, need to be dealt with by teammates. Hidden Power Ice Terrakion is a very good Gliscor lure, and Pokemon that can reliably deal with Heatran, such as Mega Charizard X, are also good teammates."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Black Sludge"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 148, "HP": 28, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 80, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [24], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Substitute", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Shadow Ball", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Will-O-Wisp", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Disable", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Sludge Wave", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Taunt", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Utility Attacker"}], "Name": "Gengar", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 1, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Levitate"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 130, "HP": 60, "Attack": 65, "Defense": 60, "SpecialDefense": 75, "Speed": 110}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Astonish", "Description": "30% chance to flinch."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Attract", "Description": "Targets of the opposite gender are infatuated and have a 50% chance to do nothing."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Body Slam", "Description": "30% chance to paralyze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brick Break", "Description": "Destroys Light Screen and Reflect, then hits."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Captivate", "Description": "Lowers an opposite gender foe's SpA 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Clear Smog", "Description": "39.8% chance to poison."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confuse Ray", "Description": "Confuses the target."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Counter", "Description": "If hit by a physical attack, returns double the damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Curse", "Description": "Does 1/4 damage per turn at the cost of half the user's max HP if the user is a Ghost.

It's important to note, however, that with Aqua Jet, Sharpedo has a much harder time gathering multiple Speed boosts. Waterfall and Crunch serve as STAB moves, attaining good neutral coverage in the metagame. Destiny Bond makes use of Sharpedo's high Speed after a couple boosts, allowing it to take out a worrisome threat as it is defeated. Even though Destiny Bond can support Sharpedo's team more, both Ice Beam and Earthquake can be used to complete Sharpedo's coverage. Ice Beam allows Sharpedo to KO Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Salamence while handling traditional physical checks such as Landorus-T and Garchomp easier.

With its lack of longevity and general fragility, Sharpedo will not be given many chances to come in, so time its use appropriately. When using Sharpedo, make as much use of Protect as possible. Through stealing free turns with Protect, Sharpedo can outspeed many notable Choice Scarf users, and at times when Sharpedo needs multiple boosts to outspeed the opponent, each Protect will count. As Sharpedo is a late-game cleaner, the more damage the opponent has taken, the better. As a result, Sharpedo pairs very well with a heavy amount of entry hazards, as this not only reliably weakens the opponent but also takes advantage of the many switches that Sharpedo forces."}, {"Content": "Politoed makes for an excellent partner, wearing down the opponent's Water-type resistances with STAB Hydro Pumps while also bolstering Sharpedo's Waterfall with Drizzle.

Nidoking's base 85 Special Attack stat is deceptively low\u2014with Sheer Force, it essentially becomes base 126. Sludge Wave is the strongest attack available to Nidoking, hitting most neutral targets extremely hard. Earth Power is a great complementary STAB move for him to use, hitting the Poison-, Rock-, and Steel-types that are resistant or immune to Sludge Wave. Between these two moves, Nidoking hits most Pokemon at least neutrally. Because of this, the last two spots can be customized for the super effective coverage that you desire. Ice Beam hits the many Ground-types in OU for good damage, especially Ground- / Flying- types that resist his STAB moves. The preferred choice in the final slot is Flamethrower for hitting the multitude of Steel-types that are neutral or immune to Earth Power, like Skarmory, Scizor, Forretress, and Ferrothorn. Thunderbolt is also a good choice to hit bulky Water-types like Jellicent and Gyarados, giving Nidoking the famed BoltBeam coverage."}, {"Content": "Although he can hit almost everything that he would want to with the above moves, Nidoking's expansive movepool lets him run many situational moves. Nidoking has access to Superpower which allows him to 2HKO Blissey. He also has access to Sucker Punch, which can surprise Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latios, Latias, and Gengar trying to revenge kill him. If your team has no other options for it, Nidoking can set up Stealth Rock, but if he has a free turn, Nidoking should have better things to do. Substitute is also helpful against offensive teams, easing prediction and letting Nidoking select the correct move for the threat in front of him without worrying about switches."}, {"Content": "The preferred nature for Nidoking is Modest, since he will either outspeed most walls or be outsped by most attackers regardless, but a Timid nature is useful for moving before positive-natured base 80 speed Pokemon such as Dragonite. Life Orb is by far the best item choice, giving a necessary boost to all of Nidoking's attacks. If using a physical move on the set\u2014notably Superpower or Sucker Punch\u2014a Rash nature is best to preserve Nidoking's physical bulk for Rock- and Fighting-type moves."}, {"Content": "Nidoking is best used as a wallbreaker with strong attacks and good coverage, making it extremely hard to switch into. He's also normally an early-game Pokemon that can weaken defensive cores. However, he lacks the bulk to be a pivot or the Speed to clean up late game. Whether or not Nidoking contributes defensively to the team depends on the opponent's team. Against Pokemon that he can check\u2014for example, Terrakion or Clefable\u2014Nidoking will be more important to keep healthy."}, {"Content": "A Fighting-type such as Terrakion or Conkeldurr is a good partner for Nidoking as they can beat Blissey and Chansey, who switch into Nidoking with ease. The real trouble with Nidoking is getting him in safely, so a slow U-turn or Volt Switch from Scizor or Rotom-W can work wonders. Like all offensive Pokemon, Nidoking appreciates having entry hazards down to punish the opponent's switches. Ferrothorn is a Stealth Rock or Spikes user that has good synergy with Nidoking, resisting Water- and Psychic-type moves while being neutral to Ground- and Ice-type attacks. In turn, Nidoking can check Fighting-types that threaten Ferrothorn.

Toxicroak finds many opportunities to boost thanks to Dry Skin and its common resistances. Gunk Shot is exceptionally powerful, dealing significant damage before and after a Swords Dance boost and targeting Fairy-types that resist Toxicroak's Fighting-type STAB. It also has a useful 30% poison chance. Steel- and Rock-types that resist Gunk Shot are dealt with by Drain Punch, healing Toxicroak in the process and making sure that it can't be worn down too easily by Life Orb recoil. In the final slot, Sucker Punch is a great addition that works extremely well in picking off weakened opponents. After a Swords Dance boost, Sucker Punch's priority can sweep offensive teams. Ice Punch is a viable option to hit Nidoking, Flygon, Crobat, and Hippowdon super effectively, but is generally not as useful. Finally, Swords Dance can be eschewed in favor of an all-out attacker set with four coverage moves. However, this means Toxicroak will rarely be able to sweep."}, {"Content": "Dry Skin is the only ability Toxicroak should use; the Water-type immunity is invaluable in checking Suicune and Mega Blastoise, as well as switching into stray Scalds. The EV spread is quite straightforward, maximizing Attack and Speed. The 4 EVs in Special Defense ensure that Porygon-Z gains an Attack boost from Download. Adamant is preferred in order to hit as hard as possible, though Jolly is viable to Speed tie with Jolly Heracross. When it comes to choosing an item, a Life Orb significantly boosts damage output, while Black Sludge trades in the added power for slightly more longevity."}, {"Content": "Toxicroak's key resistances to Dark- and Fighting-type attacks as well as its immunity to Water-type moves should be exploited. It can check the likes of Heracross, Umbreon, and Mienshao while completely stopping CroCune. Keep Toxicroak's mediocre bulk in mind though; it shouldn't be recklessly used against strong Fighting-types, as powerful resisted hits can still deal significant damage. In a similar vein, Toxicroak will find many opportunities to set up a Swords Dance as it forces out many of the above Pokemon, especially Water-types such as Mega Blastoise. Sometimes, however, it is not ideal to use Swords Dance in preparation for a sweep, namely if the opponent has a healthy physical wall such as Hippowdon or Slowbro that can survive any boosted attack and OHKO in return."}, {"Content": "Stealth Rock support is fantastic for Toxicroak; it allows Adamant Life Orb variants to KO Noivern, Rotom-H, and Mega Aerodactyl with a +2 Sucker Punch. Stealth Rock also greatly improves the chance to OHKO Slowbro with a +2 Gunk Shot. Krookodile can lay down Stealth Rock and threaten bulky Psychic-types. In return, Toxicroak can take on Water-, Bug-, and Fighting-type moves. Partners that can wear down opposing physical walls and/or appreciate Water-types being weakened are good choices. Darmanitan and Cloyster work well as wallbreakers to allow Toxicroak to sweep late-game, or vice versa. Mixed Victini also works extremely well, 2HKOing many threats that would stop Toxicroak in its tracks. Mega Absol is a nice partner as it dissuades Psychic-types from simply attacking, fearing being trapped with Pursuit. Magic Bounce also prevents status users such as Mew and Sableye from freely using Will-O-Wisp. Grass-types such as Roserade can threaten Quagsire and Swampert, which Toxicroak appreciates."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Black Sludge"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Life Orb"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 0, "HP": 0, "Attack": 252, "Defense": 0, "SpecialDefense": 4, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [11, 0], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Swords Dance", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Gunk Shot", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Drain Punch", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Sucker Punch", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Physical Attacker"}], "Name": "Toxicroak", "ChecksAndCounters": [], "Tier": 3, "PageLocation": "", "SpritePath": "", "Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Anticipation"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Dry Skin"}, {"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Poison Touch"}], "Overview": [], "BaseStats": {"SpecialAttack": 86, "HP": 83, "Attack": 106, "Defense": 65, "SpecialDefense": 65, "Speed": 85}, "OtherOptions": [], "Moves": [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Acupressure", "Description": "Boosts a random stat 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Astonish", "Description": "30% chance to flinch."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Attract", "Description": "Targets of the opposite gender are infatuated and have a 50% chance to do nothing."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Belch", "Description": "The user must eat a Berry to use this move."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bounce", "Description": "User is made invulnerable for one turn, then hits the next turn. 30% chance to paralyze."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Brick Break", "Description": "Destroys Light Screen and Reflect, then hits."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulk Up", "Description": "Boosts Atk and Def 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bulldoze", "Description": "Lowers target's Speed by 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Bullet Punch", "Description": "The user always attacks first."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Captivate", "Description": "Lowers an opposite gender foe's SpA 2 stages."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Confide", "Description": "Lowers the target's Special Attack stat by 1."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Counter", "Description": "If hit by a physical attack, returns double the damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Cross Chop", "Description": "High critical hit rate."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Cut", "Description": "No additional effect."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dark Pulse", "Description": "20% chance to flinch."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dig", "Description": "User is made invulnerable for one turn, then hits the next turn."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Double Team", "Description": "Boosts evasion 1 stage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Drain Punch", "Description": "Leeches 50% damage."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dual Chop", "Description": "Hits 2 times in one turn."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Dynamic Punch", "Description": "Confuses the foe."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earthquake", "Description": "Hits Pokemon using Dig with double Base Power."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Embargo", "Description": "Item use is prevented for five turns."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Endure", "Description": "The user always survives with at least 1 HP."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Facade", "Description": "Has 140 Base Power when burned, paralyzed, or poisoned."}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Fake Out", "Description": "The user always moves first, and flinches the foe.

Spiky Shield can be very useful for scouting and stalling for extra Leftovers or Leech Seed recovery. Leech Seed inflicts passive damage and offers some extra healing to Chesnaught while encouraging switches, which creates free turns. Hammer Arm is a reliable attacking option, dealing with notable threats such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn. The last moveslot is a toss-up between Spikes and Wood Hammer; Spikes is useful for both defensive and offensive teams, while Wood Hammer is an alternative that acts as a stronger secondary STAB attack, though the recoil often makes this option undesirable, and Grass has terrible offensive coverage. Taunt can be used to help keep status away from Chesnaught, most notably from Substitute + Toxic Aegislash, while also preventing sweepers from setting up, but Chesnaught lacks the Speed to utilize it effectively. Roar is an option to prevent setup and rack up extra entry hazard damage. Synthesis is a great choice if you want reliable recovery, especially since rain is relatively rare, and Chesnaught beats both of the sand summoners, Hippowdon and Tyranitar."}, {"Content": "Full investment in HP and Defense along with an Impish nature is used to maximize physical bulk. Leftovers is necessary as Chesnaught does not usually run Synthesis, but if Synthesis is used, Rocky Helmet is an alternative to further punish users of contact moves. Bulletproof makes Chesnaught immune to moves such as Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb, moves that it would otherwise take heavy damage from, and this ability should always be used instead of Overgrow for this reason."}, {"Content": "Using Leech Seed often is the best way for Chesnaught to play. Passive damage on the opponent and extra healing for Chesnaught while forcing switches is just amazing. It's recommended to set Leech Seed up on every foe you possibly can. If Chesnaught uses Leech Seed on a Pokemon that cannot hurt it very much, it is likely that the Pokemon will switch out, and this forced switch should be capitalized on by by setting up Leech Seed or laying Spikes against the switch-in, rather than using Spiky Shield. That said, Spiky Shield is still a great move that is ideal to use against Pokemon that commonly run Choice items, such as Keldeo, to scout moves and appropriately respond. Spikes should be set mainly on switches that Chesnaught forces with its sheer bulk, but try not to waste time setting them when the opponent can get rid of them. Instead, take advantage of these switches by using Leech Seed once more. Likewise, try not to Defog your own hazards, and use a spinner instead. Roar is also a good move to use when you predict a switch, but it's better to use it only when you have entry hazards up or when a boosted Pokemon threatens your team. When facing a boosted enemy that Chesnaught can significantly damage, such as Bisharp, don't waste your time with Leech Seed or Spikes taking unnecessary damage; just go for the KO with Hammer Arm. Chesnaught hates status, so try to keep it free of these afflictions; Taunt can help it in this regard."}, {"Content": "Chansey takes powerful special attacks, absorbs and removes status, and can pass Wishes, making it one of Chesnaught's best partners. In return, Chesnaught can take on many Steel-types that threaten Chansey, such as Bisharp, Excadrill, and Aegislash. Heatran and Chesnaught resist every one of each other's weaknesses except Fighting, and they also form a core that sets hazards, and benefits greatly from Leech Seed, making them excellent partners for each other. Rotom-H is another Pokemon that boasts similar synergy with Chesnaught, only missing out on resistances to Poison- and Psychic-type moves, both of which do not have great offensive coverage. Slowbro and Chesnaught form a solid defensive core together; Slowbro sponges Fire-, Psychic-, and  Ice-type moves, while Chesnaught shrugs off Dark- and Electric-type moves and beats the most threatening Ghost-type attacker, Aegislash. Together, they strongly check Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Charizard X, all of which are extremely powerful and popular Mega Pokemon. Zapdos covers Chesnaught's greatest weakness, Flying, and can also beat Mega Mawile and Azumarill for Chesnaught with Heat Wave and Thunderbolt, respectively."}, {"Content": "Chesnaught can opt for a Bulk Up set, but with its subpar Special Defense and numerous weaknesses, it is not an ideal user of the move. Belly Drum can be used for a massive boost in Attack, but Chesnaught lacks the Speed or powerful priority to effectively use it. Seed Bomb can be used over Wood Hammer if the recoil is undesirable. Poison Jab can be used to hit Fairy-types such as Sylveon, and Stone Edge hits common Fire- and Flying-type switch-ins such as Talonflame and Charizard, but the former lacks great coverage and the latter lacks reliability, while both are rather weak outside of hitting their targets. Substitute is an option to ease prediction and give Chesnaught a layer of protection against status and strong moves. This can work well in conjunction with Leech Seed and Spiky Shield against foes such as Talonflame: Chesnaught can simply alternate between Leech Seed and Spiky Shield to rack up significant passive damage. However, Chesnaught is too slow to utilize it very effectively, and the loss of health from Substitute can be detrimental to a Pokemon with no recovery. Furthermore, powerful sound-based moves such as Boomburst, Pixilate Hyper Voice, and Bug Buzz nail Chesnaught through Substitute. Pain Split can be used for semi-reliable recovery, especially in the sand, and can weaken healthy switch-ins.

X-Scissor is not a very powerful move by Ubers standards but is Bug Arceus's best STAB option. Be warned that Bug hits very few viable Ubers for super effective damage and is a poor attacking type. Earthquake hits the Fire-and Steel-types that resist X-Scissor very hard and can hit Fairy-types fairly hard as well."}, {"Content": "Stone Edge is usually the best option for the last slot, as it OHKOes Ho-Oh and hits Yveltal and Lugia hard after a Swords Dance boost. However, Iron Head can be used to hit Xerneas and Fairy Arceus. The former can set up a Geomancy against any Bug Arceus lacking Iron Head, so it is not a terrible option despite the lack of coverage it offers otherwise. If your team has an answer to Xerneas, such as Aegislash, then Stone Edge is the better option. Bug Arceus has other moves that it can run, but they are usually poor options. Recover extends Bug Arceus's longevity but significantly reduces its coverage, making it far easier to wall. Extreme Speed makes Bug Arceus harder to revenge kill and can theoretically be used to sweep late-game. However, Extreme Speed is very weak, even after a Swords Dance boost. Like Recover, Extreme Speed also strips Bug Arceus of valuable coverage."}, {"Content": "Bug Arceus runs a standard Swords Dance set, albeit one far less threatening than that of most other Arceus formes. Simply max out its Attack and Speed stats and use a Jolly nature to Speed tie other Arceus formes. One can opt for a spread with 212 Speed and an Adamant nature to outrun base 100s such as Palkia and Mega Kangaskhan. The increase in power is generally not worth giving up Speed ties with support Arceus formes though, as they can cripple variants using this spread with Will-O-Wisp far more reliably."}, {"Content": "Though this set is technically classified as a sweeper, the reality is that it is more likely to lure in and kill a troublesome threat than it is to actually clean. It simply does not have the power nor the typing to consistently sweep opposing teams. However, you do have a decent chance to catch unsuspecting Ho-Oh and Heatran off-guard with Stone Edge and Earthquake, respectively. If your opponent attempts to check Bug Arceus like any other Swords Dance Arceus -- with Skarmory or physically defensive Yveltal for example -- Bug Arceus is going to have a hard time because it does not have a way of powering through physical walls. Naturally, one should remove or severely weaken anything that can wall Bug Arceus before bringing it in to set up a Swords Dance."}, {"Content": "The number of Pokemon Bug Arceus can freely set up on is very limited. It can set up on standard Calm Mind Grass Arceus, as well as Groudon lacking a phazing move, Thunder Wave, Stone Edge, and Fire Punch. Most Groudon carry at least one of these moves, however, though if Groudon is badly weakened Bug Arceus can eat a Stone Edge, set up, and take it out if need be. Other than that, Bug Arceus has an awful time finding free turns to set up on. Also, be careful of switching Bug Arceus directly into an offensive Pokemon, as most powerful attacks and all status cripple it. In an emergency, it can come in on a predicted Earthquake, but that's about it."}, {"Content": "The first thing to consider when using Bug Arceus is a Defog user to remove Stealth Rock. Bug Arceus has a much better chance of actually accomplishing something if it does not have 25% of its health stripped from simply switching in. Skarmory has mediocre synergy with Bug Arceus as they share a weakness to Fire attacks (and both dislike Kyogre), so Giratina-O and Lugia are the best options. Bug Arceus also appreciates status absorbers to help deal with Will-O-Wisps. If Bug Arceus is burned, it is rendered completely useless for the rest of the match assuming you do not have a cleric. Gliscor and Heatran can easily switch in on status moves aimed at Bug Arceus."}, {"Content": "Consider using a Pokemon that can break down the Giratina formes, as Bug Arceus cannot touch them. Darkrai, Kyurem-W, and Xerneas can all deal heavy damage to them. Darkrai and Kyurem-W also help with opposing Lugia. Another Pokemon that has relatively good synergy with Bug Arceus is Dialga, as the latter resists Rock and Flying moves while the former resists Fighting moves.

Ice Beam is a spammable STAB move that Kyurem-W can fall back upon when needed, and will shatter walls such as Lugia, Groudon, specially defensive Yveltal, Grass Arceus, Ground Arceus, and Gliscor. Fusion Flare lets Kyurem-W break past the multitude of Steel-types run to deal with wallbreakers, severely damaging Aegislash, Jirachi, Steel Arceus, and Bronzong outside of rain and incinerating Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Genesect. Focus Blast is Kyurem-W's only way of getting past Blissey, as it 2HKOes it of them after Stealth Rock, and can break past Extreme Killer, Mega Kangaskhan, Rock Arceus, Dialga, and Tyranitar. However, if you want extra insurance against Steel-types in rain in addition to perfect neutral coverage, Earth Power fits the bill quite nicely, and can reliably KO Zekrom, Mega Charizard X, and Heatran."}, {"Content": "Maximum Special Attack investment is vital to Kyurem-W's success as a wallbreaker, and 4 Defense EVs rather than 4 HP EVs allow it to switch into Stealth Rock five times if necessary. 252 Speed EVs let Modest Kyurem-W Speed tie with neutral nature base 95s such as Swords Dance Rayquaza, but a Timid nature allows it to avoid the Speed tie entirely and dispose of Adamant Rayquaza with Ice Beam. A Timid Kyurem-W has other advantages over a Modest one, such as the ability to outspeed positive base 90s, taking advantage of its relatively solid Speed tier. However, it misses out on some important KOs with Draco Meteor in the process, such as the OHKO on 252 HP Arceus after Stealth Rock, and the 2HKO on the blobs after Stealth Rock. If Kyurem-W's bulk interests you, a spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Spe with a Modest nature can allow Kyurem-W to stay in the match longer, only missing out on the ability to outspeed Lugia and Yveltal."}, {"Content": "Although using Draco Meteor right off the bat is very enticing, be very careful when using it if the opponent has a Xerneas or if their Arceus forme has not been revealed yet. A poorly timed Draco Meteor can open up opportunities for the opponent to set up or use Defog to get rid of your hard-earned entry hazards. If you do not have Stealth Rock up and are not running Focus Blast on Kyurem-W, defeating Blissey is a no-go, so a teammate's assistance in dealing with Blissey is required. Though prediction is very important for any Choice user, it is especially so for Kyurem-W as its primary STAB move has an immunity. If a Fairy-type or sweeper is waiting in the wings and you predict a switch correctly, Kyurem-W can damage them beyond repair. Even though Kyurem-W's bulk is impressive, it has next to no resistances to take advantage of it, so switch in at your own risk. However, Kyurem-W can find opportunities to switch in against defensive Pokemon or entry hazard setters such as Groudon and Landorus-T and rip them to pieces. Furthermore, it doesn't mind being poisoned or burned, so play aggressively against defensively oriented teams. Try fitting Kyurem-W on teams that have trouble breaking past defensive Pokemon such as Giratina, Lugia, Blissey, and utility walls that halt the progress of sweepers."}, {"Content": "Though Kyurem-W's power is great, it's not a one-man demolition crew. It cannot KO Blissey, which stallbreakers like Yveltal or powerful Fighting-types can deal with. Mega Gengar can trap most Arceus formes and Fairy-types that give Kyurem-W trouble, and it can give Kyurem-W an opportunity to switch in when it cripples a wall with Taunt. If switching in Kyurem-W is an issue, VoltTurn support is a good option, as Kyurem-W can come in on a predicted switch with little risk involved provided entry hazards are not present. Ho-Oh is another threat Kyurem-W has to deal with, but keeping Stealth Rock on the field (Kyurem-W scares away most Defog users), having a counter to it such as Rock Arceus, or sending out a team member carrying Stone Edge can keep it in check. Keeping Stealth Rock off the field is a priority in order for Kyurem-W to switch in freely, so Defog users such as Arceus, Giratina, and Lugia are beneficial as they can clear all entry hazards or dual Screens on the field. On the other hand, spinners such as Excadrill and Forretress can maintain your own hazards, and so are superior, as having Stealth Rock in play grants Kyurem-W a chance to OHKO 252 HP Arceus and Ho-Oh with Draco Meteor and 2HKO the blobs with Focus Blast. Excadrill can both spin and set up Stealth Rock, while hazard setters like Groudon, Landorus-T, and Dialga can lay hazards down reliably at almost any point in the match. Finally, have a fallback plan against sweepers if you decide to use Draco Meteor, as Kyurem-W will be forced out, giving setup opportunities to sweepers such as Extreme Killer and offensive Xerneas with Geomancy or Calm Mind. Skarmory and physically defensive Yveltal can deal with Extreme Killer, while Ho-Oh, Jirachi, Bronzong, and Aegislash can take on Xerneas."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Choice Specs"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 252, "HP": 0, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 4, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 252}, "Natures": [24, 15], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Draco Meteor", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Ice Beam", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Fusion Flare", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Earth Power", "Description": ""}, {"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Focus Blast", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "Choice Specs"}, {"Abilities": [], "Description": [{"Content": "Though the temptation of running Choice Specs is strong, Kyurem-W can function as a Choice-less variant, as Draco Meteor still hurts without a Choice Specs boost. Ice Beam is as reliable a STAB move as ever, and with the freedom to switch moves, Kyurem-W can deal considerable damage to Lugia, Yveltal, and other Pokemon weak to Ice-type moves. Fusion Flare helps Kyurem-W against Steel-types, and even without Earth Power, Turboblaze bypasses Heatran's Flash Fire, preventing it from escaping a fiery fate. Toxic lets Kyurem-W get past bulky attackers and walls that attempt to stop its rampage and prevents Ho-Oh, the pink blobs, and Water and Electric Arceus from walling this set entirely. Roost lets Kyurem-W stay in the match for a significantly longer period of time, heals off residual damage and Life Orb recoil, and helps Kyurem-W stall out the aforementioned targets of Toxic. Kyurem-W can also utilize Substitute in conjunction with Leftovers, shielding Kyurem-W from damage and status moves, scouting out coverage moves, and allowing Kyurem-W to sweep from behind cover. Focus Blast damages targets, and can still do similar damage in comparison to Choice Specs if Life Orb is used with it due to Life Orb's slightly less powerful 1.33x boost rather than 1.5x. A Life Orb-boosted Stone Edge can be used to KO standard Ho-Oh, even if Kyurem-W has no Attack investment and an Attack-decreasing nature."}, {"Content": "A Timid nature is best used with Life Orb, letting Kyurem-W outspeed positive base 90s while still maintaining the power of a Modest nature. Leftovers should be used with a Modest nature, as bulk is more important than Speed in this case. Also, keep in mind that Kyurem-W can stall out Calm Mind Electric and Water Arceus with Toxic + Roost and Leftovers, two very potent checks that will force it out otherwise. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA with a Modest nature with Roost, Substitute, Leftovers, or Toxic can be used to turn Kyurem-W into a bulky tank. One important thing to consider when running Choice-less Kyurem-W is that with the cramped coverage options, the specific checks/counters that correspond with their specific coverage moves (such as Steel-types weak to Fusion Flare) can either be easily taken down or be impossible to break past. With the respective non-damaging moves and the items, the goals of the set change from all-out-attacking to sweeping/cleaning to outstalling walls, so the set changes dynamically depending on what you run."}, {"Content": "If you are using Life Orb with Roost, or just Roost in general, try switching into something you can force out and proceed to heal off the damage as they switch. However, if you do not need to Roost off damage, try to predict the switch well enough that you can backhand the next thing that comes in with Toxic or the correct coverage move. The same situation applies with Substitute, and has the added utility of scouting out threatening attacks. Though Draco Meteor must be used carefully, try to play aggressively as you can, as the switches Kyurem-W can force give it an opportunity to either set up a Substitute or severely damage an incoming sweeper. As mentioned before, be cautious when using Draco Meteor, as giving an opportunity for Fairy-types to come in and being immediately forced out the next turn is not fun in the slightest."}, {"Content": "Despite the decrease in power compared to the Choice Specs set, Stealth Rock is not as needed this time around, as Choice-less Kyurem-W misses out on most of the OHKOs it could achieve before. However, Kyurem-W still appreciates Stealth Rock support, as a Timid Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor can OHKO 252 / 80 Ho-Oh after entry hazard damage. Groudon is an excellent partner, as it can cripple opponents with Thunder Wave and Toxic to make Kyurem-W's life easier and Drought boosts the strength of Fusion Flare, which is invaluable in damaging Steel-types. Landorus-T can also set up Stealth Rock and can bring Kyurem-W in with U-turn. As Kyurem-W dislikes Stealth Rock on your playing field, spinners like Forretress and Excadrill are useful to keep entry hazards away. Defog can also work in this situation, but Kyurem-W appreciates the residual damage that entry hazards provides. Sticky Web and/or SmashPass support can be used to assist Kyurem-W in sweeping or cleaning. Smeargle can provide either of these, or even both, and doesn't bother team synergy too much if it is on a hyper offense team.

Pursuit is an option over Sacred Sword for any team that wants Latios and Latias eliminated. King's Shield lets Aegislash stay in after KOing something, giving it more staying power, and can also check physical attackers that rely on contact moves to harm Aegislash, such as Talonflame, Mega Scizor, and Azumarill. However, King's Shield should be used with minimum Speed and max Attack, as Aegislash benefits more from moving second than first.

It can also be used as a check to offensive Pokemon only when your primary checks are weakened or you don't want them to get weakened. You can even lead with it, as it has good match-ups against many common leads, such as Deoxys-S, Deoxys-D, and Terrakion, and can start its wallbreaking job immediately. This set can also surprise people that rely on slow or averagely fast Pokemon to check Aegislash, such as Heatran, Mega Venusaur, Mandibuzz, Landorus-T, and Bisharp, by OHKOing or 2HKOing them before they even get a chance to move, so use this to your advantage."}, {"Content": "This set fits well on any kind of team that appreciates having the opponent's team softened up.

Head Smash also beats Ho-Oh on the switch and does a ton to Yveltal/Shaymin-S but means you lose the ability to Toxic any wall, meaning Toxic is usually the better option. Gyro Ball easily OHKOs a boosted Xerneas and can do chip damage to many faster Pokemon switching in, like Darkrai. Iron Head is much more reliable but can never OHKO Xerneas even after Stealth Rock, though is much better against defensive Xerneas, which always 3HKOs it, while Gyro Ball barely 4HKOs. Shadow Ball hits some frailer Pokemon hard, but is too weak uninvested to do any major damage to bulkier Pokemon, failing even to take out a Substitute from Ho-Oh, but does a lot of damage to Mewtwo, which Aegislash can live any hit from near full health. It also 3HKOs Groudon and 2HKOs Landorus-T and Hippowdon, meaning they must be careful switching into it. Shadow Sneak can be used over Shadow Ball to revenge kill a weakened sweeper like Mewtwo or Arceus-Ghost, but will not do any major damage otherwise."}, {"Content": "Leftovers synergizes well with King's Shield and is Aegislashs only form of recovery. The EVs and Sassy nature give Aegislash maximum special bulk without compromising either attacking stat, and should be used even without Shadow Ball to increase the power of Gyro Ball and lower the chance of being hit in blade form. Running max HP and Speed with a Jolly nature and Head Smash destroys any Ho-Oh with under 100 EVs, acting as an amazing lure, but this causes a ton of recoil and a lot less bulk, as well as forcing you to run Iron Head over Gyro Ball and Shadow Sneak over Shadow Ball."}, {"Content": "Stance Change gives a well played Aegislash great bulk and power, but defensive Aegislash should not be taking unecesary hits in either form due to lack of recovery. Aegislash is not going to wall everything and should not be the only defensive Pokemon on your team, do not keep it in against something that can overpower it like Kyogre. If you can look at the opponents team and see Aegislash is useless then feel free to let it die, but using King's Shield and dropping thr oppontns Attack the turn before dying can give a teammate a chance to set up as they are forced to switch. Your STABs are weak without investment, stick to spreading Toxic until you have to attack, because you don't want to be stuck in Blade form, outside of Pokemon like Gengar or Xerneas, they will mostly be doing only chip damage. Switching when in Blade form allows you to come back in Shield form. Attacking then switching allows you to get chip damage, then switch out yourself without needing to use King's Shield. Play conservatively and avoid a burn, especially if you see a Xerneas, until you can scout what it's using and play around it."}, {"Content": "Defensive Ho-Oh resists Fire and is immune to Ground, and has good Special Defense to take hits from Yveltal, and Aegislash can take Rock-type moves for Ho-Oh, but neither can handle Kyogre.

If they do, either spam Toxic to catch them as they switch in, or use Substitute if they are already affected by Toxic, and start stalling them to death by alternating between Substitute and King's Shield. If the opponent has a Bisharp, the best course of action is to either use Substitute in case it switches in, allowing Aegislash to switch out and avoid the Pursuit, or double switch to a Pokemon that can handle Bisharp. Also, make sure to keep Aegislash away from Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off at all costs, as Leftovers is essential to Aegislash's Toxic stalling strategy and it can't be done without it. Other than that, Aegislash can be used to check any threatening Pokemon with Shadow Ball, as long as it's healthy enough.

Keldeo checks Bisharp pretty well, as does Quagsire, bulky Mega Charizard X, and Mega Gyarados (preferably with Moxie on regular Gyarados).

However, Rotom-W and Landorus-T are also fine options for checking Fire- and Ground-types that can also use their pivoting moves to give Aegislash an advantageous match-up in order to set up a Substitute. Wish support is nice to have if you can fit it on your team, as Aegislash usually takes its time to do work, and reliable healing really helps a set that relies on the use of Substitute so often and lets Aegislash stall out multiple foes. Finally, Pokemon that appreciate the weakening of the threats that Toxic Aegislash lures and weakens, such as specially defensive Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, and Chesnaught, pair well with Aegislash. Good examples of such Pokemon are Mega Charizard Y (which can 2HKO Hippowdon with Toxic damage), Mega Charizard X (Mandibuzz is much easier to get into OHKO range of +1 Flare Blitz when affected with Toxic), and Mega Gyarados (Toxic makes Chesnaught's Leech Seed + Spiky Shield stalling tactics ineffective)."}], "Items": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Leftovers"}], "EVSpread": {"SpecialAttack": 252, "HP": 244, "Attack": 0, "Defense": 12, "SpecialDefense": 0, "Speed": 0}, "Natures": [15], "Moves": [[{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Shadow Ball", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "King's Shield", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Toxic", "Description": ""}], [{"PageLocation": "", "Name": "Substitute", "Description": ""}]], "Name": "SubToxic"}, {"Abilities": [{"PageLocation": "", "Description": "", "Name": "Stance Change"}], "Description": [{"Content": "Swords Dance allows Aegislash to wallbreak and OHKO frail offensive Pokemon with Shadow Sneak.

Iron Head is Aegislash's best option against Hippowdon, OHKOing specially defensive variants at +2 with a layer of Spikes, while also being Aegislash's most reliable option against most defensive Pokemon, such as Mandibuzz, Landorus-T, Clefable, Gliscor, and Mega Venusaur.

Charizard-Y also gains so much power in the sunlight that it doesn't really need the extra strength offered by Modest, though it can be used if your team can handle the Pokemon previously mentioned. Although Charizard-Y should Mega evolve immediately anyways, Blaze should be used instead of Solar Power as this set's default ability to avoid taking damage in sunlight. "}, {"Content": "The purpose of this set is essentially to destroy anything that it comes by. It can operate in nearly any part of the game, but shines especially well mid- to late-game, where it can wallbreak or clean up the opposing team as required.

Because of these traits, it can switch into common attacks, such as Earthquake, Knock Off, Iron Head, Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, Scald, Lava Plume, Moonblast, and other miscellaneous weak special attacks with ease. Another small but notable detail is that it can stomach some strong special attacks at full health; for instance, Life Orb Latias's Draco Meteor can only do 73.1 \u2013 86.2%, allowing Charizard-Y to recover with Roost while stalling Latias out thanks to Draco Meteor's special attack drop. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for strong physical attacks, so it is not advised to recklessly switch into these types of moves unless resisted."}, {"Content": "Charizard-Y has a nasty Stealth Rock weakness, which can be taken care of with Defog or Rapid Spin support. Latias, Latios, Excadrill, Starmie, and Mew are good teammates that can clear away entry hazards safely and quickly; the former four are also notable for their good offensive power and coverage. Charizard-Y also appreciates defensive support, as it ideally wants to switch in multiple times while avoiding Rock- and Electric-type attacks. Hippowdon and Chesnaught are bulky walls that can absorb Thunderbolts and Stone Edges while also providing entry hazard support. More offensive teammates that can take these attacks include Assault Vest Raikou, Aegislash, Excadrill, and Landorus-T. Pairing it with a Pursuit trapper such as Tyranitar, Aegislash, or Bisharp will greatly benefit Charizard and help it succeed in breaking down the opposing team with sun-boosted Fire Blasts. This deals with the Lati twins, and in the case of Bisharp, puts more pressure on Chansey."}, {"Content": "Additionally, while this set breaks through a ton of defensive Pokemon, it notably has trouble dealing with Chansey and Blissey, both of which have more than enough Special Defense to switch into Fire Blast and heal off the damage repeatedly. Therefore, teammates that can beat them are absolutely required. Gothitelle is a fantastic partner for this, as it doesn't care much about incoming Toxics or Thunder Waves and can use Trick and Psyshock to completely dismantle the two pink blobs. More offensive alternatives for this role include Terrakion, Bisharp, Choice Band Tyranitar, Thundurus (with Knock Off and Superpower), Scizor, and Keldeo. Offensive support against opposing Latios and Latias (as well as other Dragon-types in general) is also appreciated; again, Tyranitar, Aegislash, and Bisharp are good teammates, especially since they have access to Pursuit. The latter can also use its ability, Defiant, to punish both if they attempt to use Defog."}, {"Content": "One thing to note is that Charizard-Y is skilled at wallbreaking.

Protect helps turn Wish into reliable recovery and can also be used to scout your opponent's moves or net an extra turn of Leftovers recovery. Scald is a reliable, albeit weak STAB move that keeps it from being Taunt bait and has a nifty 30% chance to burn the opponent which is always nice for a wall.

Regenerator is an amazing ability, recovering a third of Alomomola's health when it switches out, which it will be doing a lot when it passes Wishes. A Bold nature should be used over Relaxed unless you choose to run Knock Off over Toxic, because it helps minimize damage from Foul Play and confusion."}, {"Content": "Alomomola should mainly be used to pass enormous Wishes and to switch into physical attackers.

With a bit of prediction, it can come in on Victini, but it must be wary of Bolt Strike, as Alomomola is 2HKOed by Choice Band Victini's Bolt Strike making it hard for Alomomola to reliably check it. Scald should only be used for its burn chance and to keep Alomomola from being useless against Taunt users. Toxic should be used to stall out opponents and win stall wars with other Pokemon such as Slowbro. Also, its ability to put sweepers on a timer can be the difference between winning and losing a battle. Keep in mind that when using Alomomola you can lose a lot of momentum and therefore is not suited for offensive teams, but functions well in stall and balanced teams."}, {"Content": "Bulky Grass-types make excellent partners for Alomomola as they resist both of its weaknesses.

Mega Ampharos has no recovery outside of Rest and covers Alomomola's weaknesses, making them good options to use together. Frail sweepers such as Mega Absol, Mega Houndoom, and Starmie also benefit greatly from Alomomola's massive wishes. Pokemon that can remove Grass-types make awesome teammates for Alomomola.

Quiver Dance is essential, boosting Vivillon's Special Attack and Speed stats to more threatening levels and paving the way for a potential sweep. Hurricane is Vivillon's strongest STAB move; with its 91% accuracy and decent coverage, it is a very spammable move that can deal heavy damage even when resisted. Bug Buzz is a great secondary STAB move, hitting most Pokemon that resist Flying for neutral damage; it also has a chance to lower Special Defense and bypasses Substitutes.

A Timid nature is crucial to outspeed Choice Scarf Heracross after a Quiver Dance boost, allowing Vivillon to OHKO it with a 4x super effective Hurricane. The four leftover EVs are tossed into Special Defense, as Quiver Dance boosts it anyway and Vivillon is already horrendously frail on the physical side. The items both have their benefits; Life Orb allows Vivillon to effectively break through special walls, something it cannot do with any other item, while Focus Sash ensures that Vivillon will be able to either put the opposing Pokemon to sleep or set up. Alternatively, a Lum Berry can be used to give Vivillon a layer of protection against debilitating status afflictions."}, {"Content": "Vivillon surprisingly forces a large amount of switches, especially if the opponent's Pokemon is a wall or a win condition, so capitalize on this properly, and Vivillon can find itself with more than one Quiver Dance boost under its belt. Vivillon's one-dimensional nature can also be used to its advantage; double-switch into a favorable match-up, set up a Quiver Dance, or go straight for a Hurricane as the opponent brings in their Grass-type to absorb the predicted Sleep Powder. Using Quiver Dance on the switch is often the best play, as Vivillon can usually outspeed most Grass-types lacking a Choice Scarf and hit even harder at +1 Special Attack. However, do be cautious of Overcoat users, as they can switch into Sleep Powder with no repercussion. The common Choice Scarf Victini and Darmanitan will also outspeed Vivillon even after a Quiver Dance, so be wary if the opponent has either of these two Pokemon in their team. Taunt also cripples Vivillon by preventing it from using Sleep Powder or Quiver Dance, so keep it away from common users of this move such as Aerodactyl. Vivillon can also be used on hyper offensive teams; send it in after your team's suicide lead has been KOed to prevent setup or removal of entry hazards by the opponent."}, {"Content": "A Defogger or spinner is nearly essential, as Vivillon hates losing half of its health from Stealth Rock upon switching in; Empoleon, Blastoise, and Starmie fit this role relatively well, taking Fire-type attacks relatively well and Starmie can even act as a status absorber with Natural Cure. Defensive Defog Flygon is an excellent partner, walling pretty much any physical Fire-type while clearing entry hazards. Vivillon also pairs well with setup sweepers such as Toxicroak and Azelf, which can easily dispatch the Grass-types that it attracts. Volt Switch or U-turn users also benefit Vivillon, allowing it to enter the battlefield unscathed.
