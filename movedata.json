Its biggest draw is undoubtedly its ability to increase the evasion stat of the user without breaking the Evasion Clause, which prevents the use of moves such as Minimize and Double Team in Smogon's standard competitive metagames. However, in most cases it is not worth the bother to try to stall for the evasion boost, as the chances of it occurring before the user is knocked out by the opponent's attacks, and then being of use afterwards, are at best minimal. Competitively speaking, more reliable boosting moves are favored; however, Acupressure is infamous for its integral role in several noteworthy strategies for pulling off win streaks in the Battle Subway, when coupled with a Trick or Flash user—Drapion with Acupressure, Rest, Substitute, and Crunch is the most well-known of these."

When boosted by the rain provided by Drizzle Politoed in OU, one of the most defining characteristics of the metagame is to be sure that at least a couple of your Pokemon can take a STAB Hydro Pump from the likes of Choice Specs Politoed, Life Orb Starmie, and Choice Scarf Rotom-W. To say that Hydro Pump is one of the best attacks in the game wouldn't be an overstatement. Hydro Pump is also the sweeping attack of choice for many special Swift Swim sweepers in the lower tiers, including Kingdra, Ludicolo, Omastar, and Gorebyss. However, Hydro Pump does come with one major drawback: 80% accuracy. This means that it can, and will on occasion, miss at the most inopportune times. Therefore, many players will opt to use the perfectly accurate Scald or Surf instead of Hydro Pump to ensure that their attack will always hit."

Hurricane can also be utilized by Tornadus and Dragonite, for it also has 100% accuracy.

It is illegal to have a Pokemon with Swift Swim and a Pokemon with Drizzle on the same team in Smogon's standard OU; however, no such restriction applies to Rain Dance. Pokemon with Swift Swim can seriously exploit the effects of rain, because not only does it double the Pokemon's Speed, allowing it to outrun almost any Pokemon, but it also boosts their Water-type STAB moves through the roof, turning Pokemon like Kingdra and Kabutops into absolute monsters.

While paralysis isn't as useful as sleep, and some would argue burn, it is still extremely useful for a variety of reasons and can be used for many different strategies. As paralysis cuts the Speed of the inflicted almost down to nothing, it makes it suddenly plausible for normally slow Pokemon to outspeed the enemy's team and take them out one by one. Paralysis also tends to fully incapacitate the opponent in the most useful of times, and this can be further abused with the use of flinching moves and confusion. When combined with confusion, the condition is normally referred to as parafusion. Throw in a flinching move to confusion, and suddenly the opponent has a very low chance of moving successfully. This strategy is most commonly abused by Jirachi and Togekiss, who also sport the Serene Grace ability to make their flinching moves a higher chance to cause the opponent to flinch.

Even so, while Acrobatics is certainly not the most powerful of moves competitively, it does have a few applications in certain situations.

Its biggest drawback is its low PP, which when coupled with the large number of Pokemon with Pressure in Lugia's Ubers environment is a big drawback indeed.

More importantly, Lugia has so many options that Aeroblast is a relative outsider. It needs its supporting moves and reliable recovery to function effectively as a wall, which generally leaves only one moveslot for an attacking option. Aeroblast is only worth using on more offensive Lugia sets."

However, the killing feature behind Air Slash is its 30% flinch rate, which if you are faster essentially means that you have almost a 1 in 3 chance to stop the opponent from doing anything that turn, which can be game-changing if it occurs at the right time. However, some Pokemon can take this to extremes. Togekiss and Shaymin-S both have Serene Grace for their ability, which doubles the flinch chance to 60%. Thus, the odds of the opponent doing nothing in a turn are the same odds of Hypnosis hitting its target. While Shaymin-S can rely on its high Speed to achieve this game-winning formula, Togekiss must rely on bulk and Thunder Wave—a nasty surprise which brings the odds of the opponent doing nothing to 68%—to perform the same trick."

On the other hand, it can be useful on full stall teams that have problems dealing with that last Pokemon that is immune to Toxic, who can otherwise boost without fear of being forced out by phazing moves, and sweep the team, such as Metagross or Lucario. However, if Curse is used, it can create a \"win condition\" considering that the foe can't switch out to nullify the effects, and apart from Magic Guard users nothing is immune to it.
